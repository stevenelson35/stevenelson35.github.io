Then I tried to encourage Frankie to join the photo and jump into the frame before all the pets decided they had matters of consequence to attend to. That gave us time for a single timed photo.

    "body": "2024/07/11 - On our way south we detoured towards Hartford to Danbury and Ridgefield with a stop in Stamford for lunch with Camilla’s cousins. Before leaving Newport, I took in a few sites.   Camilla wanted to go to the fitness center in the hotel. Wimbeldon was on the TV.  Linda finished packing.  And may have packed the shells she found yesterday.  And then we were on our way! The bridge off the island was foggy.  One small town we drove through in Connecticut had a McDonalds with an older arch sign. We did not eat there.  We stopped for a restroom in a small town near Sandy Hook. Once we got to Danbury we saw the familiar mall intersection with Dick’s and LL Bean (not shown).  We took a detour up Pine Mountain Road to see what that was like, since from google maps it looks like a great place to have a house near large forests. The road didn’t look very inviting in person, though. We drove from Danbury through Ridgefield to Stamford. Along the way we drove around Ridgefield High School.  We recognized this Ridgefield Veterinary that we saw last year which may not be operational.  And saw this shoe in Ridgefield.  Finally we made it to Stamford for lunch at the Parkway Diner. We talked a lot about Emily’s plans for college. The waitress had a daughter that was attending a college.   "

    "title": "Sausages And Topiary",
    "body": "2024/07/10 - We explored Sachuest Point and a topiary garden. Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge has 2. 5 miles of nature trails bordering a rocky shore and beach. It is a small penninsula off of the Aquidneck Island where Newport is found. When looking at a map, Camilla suggested it looks like an ostrich. The grassy park is home to many deer, rabbits, and birds. The entrance to the trail had a sign clearly warning of ticks.  The first animal we saw was a pheasant. Just a few feet down the trail in plain sight.  It didn’t take long to see deer in the field.  Although it was a short walk, Camilla still likes to be carried whenever she can convince someone to pick her up.  Unless she is looking for animals on the ground.  Maybe she was looking at these snail shells.  Bunnies were also easy to find along the trail.  We followed one trail to the rocky shore.   Occasionally there was a rock that looked different than the other rocks.  Linda always likes to look for creatures. She found some.    One deer had antlers.  The deer sometimes walked right along the path after we passed.  There were always sounds of different birds to look for in the trees.  Apparently the bunnies had been busy creating more bunnies. They were abundant.      After our walk, the wildlife center was open. We used the restrooms and talked to the volunteer about the refuge and life on the island. After raising kids on the island, she had moved to southeast Florida for a bit. Now she spends time in the northeast with trips to St. Augustine, FL instead of southeast FL.  We passed a windmill on the way to the topiary gardens.  We also passed this tree.  It may have been asking the question that Linda has on her mind: “Y are you taking so many pictures?” At the topiary garden, Linda quickly spotted this tick.    We found a rock that gave a little better view of the sea over the wall at the edge of the topiary site. Camilla likes to look out into the distance. What is she thinking about?  There was a big old tree near the house at the topiary site. Camilla and Linda posed on the rock. It was a quiet space in the shade with a nice view.     "

    "body": "2024/07/09 - We toured The Breakers and Cliff Walk on our first full day in Newport, Rhode Island. We walked to a nice, inexpensive Greek diner for breakfast. On the way back to our hotel, we walked along streets with old houses, flowers, and a community garden.  The park behind the garden had an elephant statue from India representing a specific elephant. We would see more of these elephants at other locations around Newport.   Hydrangea were very common in Newport. Linda said she read the title of an article that said Hydrangea are doing very well in the Northeast this year. She didn’t read the article, so, we don’t know why that is the case.  Maybe the heat? There were a few roses looking healthy. Not quite as amazing as the roses in Montreal last year, but pretty nice.  Camilla Posed by a restaurant near our hotel.  Whenever we walked back to the hotel, Camilla would hide along the columns.  And Linda would follow, walking at vacation speed ;).  We parked on a side street near The Breakers and walked to the famous house. At first, we started to walk down the driveway of a large building of (Salve Regina University)[https://salve. edu/] by mistake.  Then we headed for The Beakers along a sidewalk near a mossy fence.  The Breakers was built as a summer cottage by the Vanderbilt family.  The main room of The Breakers was huge with a painted ceiling. Chairs had been placed for a music concert on the main floor. There were numerous events around Newport this summer showcasing music at different venues.  Behind a grand stairway to the left of the main room was a fountain and sitting area. Linda said this might be her favorite place to sleep here because she could hear the sound of the water.  The left room looked like this.  The walls often had paintings of the family members and symbols that were meaningful to the family.  Acorns and oak leaves were important symbols for the Vandebilts, representing strength and longevity. They appear on the family crest.  Here is Gladys Moore Vanderbilt.  The room on the right of the main room included a piano. Someone was married in that room.  Upstairs were bedrooms for the family. Some rooms had old phones like this.  The bedrooms for the family typically had bathrooms with two tubs. The main bath tub had four knobs to control water. These supplied hot and cold fresh water as well as hot and cold salt water.  The family members often changed clothes up to seven times a day, bathing between changing, and possibly napping. To bathe the lower half to freshen up, they could use these smaller soaking tubs.  Some servants could freshen clothes in the closets, prepare the bath, and change the bedding (multiple times a day) using hidden passageways.  They could be contacted using a call system which activated indicators on a panel.   There was a great open patio off the main floor from which you could see the back yard and ocean below the cliffs.   Outside there was a herd of elephants from India like the one we saw walking back from breakfast earlier in the day.  The backyard bordered the cliffs to the sea. On the other side of the fence was an entrance to the Cliff Walk which extends a few miles along the coast.   The side of the house had a mossy railing.  We walked back around the front of the house to exit and follow the road on the right of the house down to the Cliff Walk so we could walk in front of The Breakers and eventually reach the Forty Steps park near our car.  There were a lot of wild flowers along the path outside the grounds.  We looked over the sea from the cliffs.  Linda and Camilla Walked down forty steps to the sea from the park along the Cliff Walk.  Camilla pondered many things looking down to the sea.   Once we got back to our hotel, we walked to the marina to see some birds, flowers, and the Lobster Shack. We didn’t eat at the Lobster Sack, but did find lobster rolls at another restaurant in Newport. The seagulls were surprisingly large compared to what we see at the beaches in Florida.  There isn’t anything in this picture to give a reference for the size of this seagull. Just imagine that the post in the picture the seagull is standing on is as big as an elephant - a small elephant.   Later we drove to a store across from the International Tennis Hall of Fame Museum. We didn’t look inside, but, recognized it by all the flags above the entrance.   "

And periodically symbols like this. Apparently this indicates where a crossing occurs in the freeway for emergency vehicles.  We went to a rest stop where there were some flowers.  Here’s one of the flowers.  And another rest stop that looked familiar.  We recognized Stamford by the building with the W on it. Maybe wrestling? Camilla waved to Aunt Julie from the car as we drove through Stamford while Julie was at work.  We drove through the town of Wilton, CT to checkout the area and have lunch at The Little Pub in Wilton. We had been to a different The Little Pub the year before in Greenwich.  It was time for dinner when we got to Newport, so we walked to dinner past this bank.  Along the way walked under a tree that had branches growing downward that were trimmed about head height.  The low evening sun made for interesting shadows.  The restaurant we went to had sailing decorations and a buffalo on the walls. There was a familiar ice cream shop, Kilwins, that we recognized from Winter Park.  We stopped for ice cream.  On the way back to the hotel we walked out to view the harbor and saw this symbol of Hope on the ground.  Here’s our Newport pic w/ the harbor and the sun.  A bell was on display that was the biggest cast bell in all the lands.  Here it is.  "

We tried to get a final family pic in front of the water park, but, Camilla wasn’t in the mood for pictures.  So we took a few parent pics.  Ten pin bowling was fun. It’s like a scaled down version of the bowling we’re used to. The ball is smaller and doesn’t have any holes in it.   Camilla used her wand to help us pack up the car before beginning our drive.  We tried to give our Wolf pass to another family to use any benefits we hadn’t used, but, the intent may have been lost in translation. We did get a family pic after we checked out as we walked to the car.  We passed the birthplace of George Washington and saw this sign.  We also saw this cloud.  Originally we planned to stay another day and have a long day of driving on Monday. However, we already had plenty of time at the lodge to do what we wanted and it was too hot to explore the old Williamsburg, so we left a day early to get a start on our drive. With the early departure, instead of trying to drive straight through to Newport, RI, we took a leaisurely drive to Delaware for the night.  We stopped in Newark, DE for the night. Linda thought that although it was very hot on our trip north, that the days seemed to be getting shorter. Actually, the daylight hours were actually a bit longer in Newark than in Oviedo on this day.  "

    "body": "2024/07/06 - Woke up early to get wet and play Magic Quest and go to the arcade. Camilla loves Magic Quest. She played it fof the first time last year at the Great Wolf Lodge in Niagara. It involves walking around each floor of the hotel and pointing a wand at various items to proceed through the quest to ultimately fight a dragon.  This quest was in the land of Vellara.  Here’s a map: Camilla is ready for the quest with her wand and wolf ears.  This is how you point a wand.  There are many wands you can select from the store with various upgrades.  Often you have to go to a kiosk to get directions for what to find next as you progress through the stages of the quest.  We enjoy the quest with Camilla because you walk alot as you traverse the three floors (usually using the stairs) to repeatedly pass through each hallway where the game items are on display.  Some highlights from the quest are in the pictures below.    The first major challenge we faced was learning the code to activate the dragon. After struggling to select the symbols in the correct order to crack the code, another guest pointed out that the code symbol order is revealed when you activate the the dragon picture on a lower floor. You just hat pay attention to the order that the lights are lit. However, once you’ve activated the dragon paiinting, you cannot see the clue again. Fortunately, someone told us the order so we could continue the quest.  Defeating the dragon was difficult and took Linda’s expert skills.   It took many attempts, but, eventually Linda figured out how to help Camilla defeat the dragon and finish the quest.  Camilla made the leader board displayed on the wall.  Later we played some arcade games. Camilla likes to race the motor bikes.  I couldn’t find a good song reference for the day, so, since we woke up and defeated a fire breathing dragon and played in an arcade, I thought that maybe this song with David Bowie is appropriate by title alone.  Also, I think Linda likes Arcade Fire. Maybe.  Arcade Fire - Wakeup w/ David Bowie   "

Then somewhere I saw this blurry multi-color flower.  Camilla surprised us by wanting to go on the scariest water slide: the Tornado! She was tall enough for the ride, but, wanting to go on the Tornado was a big change from last year when she stuck to the kiddie slides. Although we didn’t get many pictures of the slides, I did get this picture of the outside of the Tornado as seen from our hotel room. It shows the shape of a feature that gives the slide its name. The slide is mostly pretty dark in the tubes of the Tornado. The Tornado seats up to four people on a tube. Linda skipped the slide on our first voyage so that we’d be sure to have one survivor to return to Oviedo to tell the tale of our daring adventure to our pets if things didn’t go as planned. Linda joined us on a second ride down the Tornado, after we demonstrated it was safe and you didn’t get too wet.  Throughout the day we alternated between the wave pool, the hot tub, and slides.    Camilla tried nearly every slide in the park. She even tried the bodyboard surf simulator. For that, you jump off a platform onto a bodyboard and ride it down a wall of water. It is like you are body surfing down the face of a large, continuous wave. Camilla’s swim lessons have definitely given her some courage when it comes to playing in the water.

It rained a bit and we weren’t sure if there would be a full fire works display in Williamsburg or not due to weather.  We heard a few explosions, but didn’t see anything from the hotel. Camilla wasn’t interested in fireworks anyway.  Instead, she enjoyed some popcorn and tablet time :).   Today’s the fourth of July.  Another June has gone by.

We forgot to bring a brush, so Camilla wasn’t able to comb her hair after swimming, but we did remember to bring sun hats. First we stopped at Panera for lunch and to pose by a tree.  At the end of the trip to Leu Gardens we took a family photo (foreshadowing).  This was the last day of the Glass In Flight sculpture exhibit at Leu Gardens. Here’s an example of the type of sculptures that were scattered throughout the gardens.  We didn’t put much effort into finding all the sculptures even though there was a map. We just wandered around and saw what we saw. We saw one bird. Here it is.  Here’s another sculture with glass wings.  In a shady gazebo we took a mother daughter photo in honor of Mother’s Day.  At least that was an acceptable reason for me to convince Linda and Camilla to look at the camera without being too annoyed.  We even took one rare photo without Camilla’s glasses.  We saw one tree with peeling green bark.  A butterfly was stealing some flower stuff from a flower in the vegetable garden.  On the fence of the vegetable garden Linda identified some blackberries that were just starting to ripen.  Fortunately there are a lot of trees at Leu Garden. One time when we were out of tree cover, Camilla ran to the next shady spot to stay out of the sun. In reality, she probably was just looking for an opportunity to run. She likes to run and doesn’t like to stand still very often. During our walk around the gardens, I took some pics of flowers, trees, and ocassionally Camilla and Linda. Here’s a Magnolia Flower.  Here’s a tree.  Most pictures I have of Linda and Camilla are of them walking away from me, like this.  This flower had a red bug on it; just like the red bug we saw in Fort Myers which appears in another blog post.  We found a shady spot with a bench so we sat down to rest. Camilla had too much energy so she played charades instead of resting.    While Linda sat in the shade where we had played charades, Camilla posed by some metal sculptures. Here’s the kid on a scooter sculpture. Camilla is holding a rose horizontally to match the pose in the sculpture of the kid on a scooter.  The rose was given to Linda at the entrance of the park for Mother’s Day.  Sometimes Camilla posed with me. Here’s the kid on shoulders sculpture with me posing with a kid on my shoulders.  And here’s the grandpa and kid fishing sculpture and Camilla holding her rose fishing rod.  We saw a red pineapple in two locations in the gardens.  Here’s one.  It slowly became warmer throughout the day, but overall the weather was surprising pleasant considering the recent days of high ninety degree weather in Orlando.  After a few hours we left the trees, flowers, and glass sculptures behind.  "

We went further inland whenever someone walking a dog would approach so that Frankie wouldn’t see them and bark.  He barks loudly.  He is a friendly dog.  But, also a loud one ;).

There were a lot of speed traps in the area, so there’s a chance one of the police cars we saw along the road might have taken the dog to safety. We had hoped to drive far enough that the remainder of the trip would be an easy Saturday morning drive (of 3-4 hours) to arrive in Oviedo in time for Camilla’s friend’s birthday party. However, we ended up stopping at a hotel in McDonough, just south of Atlanta, which left six hours driving for Saturday. This Courtyard Inn was a much cleaner hotel than we encountered in Mt.

Also, this time we found that the hot tub was polluted by bodily fluids – the water was very green in color and had brown floating suds. ;p It is better to forget that experience and remember the beautiful arch we drove past earlier in the day.

In the morning when unplugging her car, Linda noticed that it appears that someone keyed her new car right above the electric plug connector. We figure it likely was the person in the large pickup that parked right next to her the night before at dinner where she had purposely parked in the farthest spaces in the lot away from all the other cars.  Not so Iowa nice :(. At Pins and Putts we played nine holes of indoor mini golf.  The putting game was point based instead of stroke based, with each hole getting 5000 bonus if you sink the first putt that which also placed the ball for your second putt near (or in) the final hole.  We saw baby Bowen for the first time and Camilla held him.  Earlier in the trip we saw snowfall and Camilla got to play in the snow. However, she had not built a snowman. In Iowa, there was no snow on the ground. However, Uncle Russ had saved snow for Camilla from last year in his freezer.  Camilla was able to use the saved snow for a quick snowball fight and to build two snowmen.  She even added a carrot nose.  And two eyes of kibble.   Snowflakes are one of natures most fragile things, but, look what they can do when they stick together.  Frosty the Snowman"

We attempted taking a few detours to avoid traffic when the map app suggested it, but, so did everyone else on the road.  I think the added stress of Fourth Of July weekend traffic compounded the driving slowdowns.  It took about nine hours travelling time with stops and (many) traffic slowdowns to get home.

It was a bit too addictive, so in the future we’ll have to watch her around arcades with that game.  At the arcade, you earn virtual tickets for each game played that you can exchange for a prize.  Camilla’s goal was to get a blow pop sucker.  She got one and the blue teeth in this picture is proof.   In this next picture, Camilla is giving me the ‘no more pictures’ finger, but smiling. Sometimes she isn’t smiling when she does that.  We considered eating at the rotating tower restaurant to see the falls from above.  We even had reservations twice.  But, with the Canadian fires we didn’t think the view would be as good as from the ground due to the smokey haze in the air.

    "body": "2023/06/24 - We spent our third full day in Montreal at the Biodome de Montreal. First, a note about Montreal.  There appears to be a lot of focus among the fashonistas and urban professionals. For example, the garage we park our car at in the condo complex has many trophy cars like this Mercedes.  Each morning has found me searching out caffeine and breakfast sandwiches. The most reliable source has been Tim Hortons, which appears to be a Canadian Dunkin’ Donuts. To try to make the caffeine trek worthwhile I take a different route each time. This morning I passed West Elm and was able to grab a pic of this ad of this English man that are all over that Linda may like to be aware of in case she gets over her fear of Winter and wants to move north sometime.  On another walk, I passed these steps again.  The [biodome] (https://espacepourlavie. ca/en/biodome) is part of a complex hosted in the old 1976 Summer Olympic buildings in the Olympic District. We drove the the Olympic District and parked in the stadium garage and had to find our way to the sites.  The buildings include the World’s largest angled structure which is a tower at 45 degrees that supports a dome.  Camilla showed off some Ballet moves walking through the biodome.    Most of the time I’m forbidden from taking pictures of Linda or Camilla. For some reason Camilla decided to take a selfie with me.  And take a picture of herself.  And me.  The biodome itself had four climate/habitat zones with various animals, but, it was really a small zoo. One interesting creature was this frog.  The gift shops often have many childrens books, but, I can’t read French so I’m not sure what they are about.  I’m guessing I can guess what this one is about.  Camilla got a Cat hair clip.  After the biodome we walked towards the gardens.  Along the way, we found a skate park.  It wasn’t very busy.  A family explained that it is typically packed, but, since it is St. John Baptiste day, many people have alternate plans.  Apparently that is like Quebec’s independence day (each province may have their own holiday like that).  It happened that the father that was skating had the same board Mark Gonzales board I have from the 80s.  At the gardens we saw many plants and wished we had skipped the biodome to have more time to walk in the parks.  Roses of every color were in full bloom – much healthier than we’ve seen at Leu Gardens.  We found the Chinese gardens.    Later we finally found the Japanese gardens. Camilla got tired of walking, but allowed us to take a quick walk through the Japanese Gardens.  The entrance to the Japanese gardens had very tall trees covered with white flowers (at least twice as tall as shown in this picture).  In addition to the biodome, gardens, and skate park, the Olympic District includes an Insectarium and planetarium.  Driving to the district allowed us to see some less urban and less affluent neighborhoods of Montreal.  It was nice to see some of the olympic buildings had found a second life.  1976 Montreal Summer Olympics    Also known as: Games of the XXI Olympiad and (French: Jeux de la XXIe Olympiade)  Canada did not win any gold medals.   It was the first (and only) olympics hosted by Canada.   29 countries boycotted the games because Canada didn’t ban New Zealand after New Zealand rugby team didn’t honor a United Nations sprting embargo and had toured South Africa.   Security was visible due to recent Munich Massacre.   Bruce Jenner won the decathalon with a Wolrld Record number of points (and likely was on Wheaties box).   Japanese gymnast Shun Fujimoto performed on a broken right knee performing a perfect triple dismount from rings to enable the Japanese team to win gold.   East Germany surpassed all expectations for a middle-sized nation by finishing with the second most gold medals in total.        Their achievements were undermined by the revelation of a doping scandal.     It was later revealed that after injecting athletes with performance-boosting drugs at the Montreal Olympics, East German officials dumped the leftover serum and syringes in the Saint Lawrence River.        The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.   The 1976 Winter Games were held in Innsbruck Austria.  ref: 1976 Summer Olympics "

We walked along the main road along the park with some sculptures and this stairway art.  We entered the undergound city through the metro depot.  Although there are entrances to the city tunnels all over the place, they all seemed to be hiding in plain sight.  We had trouble knowing which way to go once we entered the depot.  Not being able to read the French signs probably didn’t help.  Much of the underground city consists of shopping malls.  That’s probably why the next day someone laughed when we mentioned we had gone to the undergound city and they said “oh, you mean the shopping mall”.  On the way back from the mall, we stopped at a park with a tree sculpture.  Being worn out from a day of walking, we stopped at a familiar place – McDonald’s – where we found a few different menu items than we were used to like the McWrap, Snack Wrap, Vegetarian Big Mac, and some baked goods.  By the time we arrived at the touristy area of Montreal, Camilla hwas already wearing her new high-tops from the mall.  Camilla tried on some hats.  I had bought a pair of Levi’s at the mall. While shopping at the touristy shops, we found out that the security tag had not been removed from my jeans, so we decided to split up. I trekked back to the mall to get the security tag removed (and secretly returned to the touristy shops to get Linda’s travel gift) and quickly stopped for a few photos along the way.  Meanwhile, Linda and Camilla returned to the condo and had ice cream.

The Notre-Dame Basilica has an interior that is amongst the most dramatic in the world and regarded as a masterpiece of Gothic Revival architecture. It was designed by an Irish-American from New York who is the only person buried in the Basilica’s crypt.   While we were doing a self guided tour, a choir group from Minnesota was practicing.    So we had to be quiet.  Camilla rested while listening to the music.  Outside the Basilica we looked at a statue and toured the Bank of Montreal.  Then we went back to the condo and checked out the two rooftop pools and the indoor pool and gym.  All the facilities were being put to good use by the young local professional residents.  Montreal has a reputation for being host to influencers and tech companies that established sites there during the development of the multimedia city region.  Later in the evening we returned to the Basilica for the light show AURUA. The AURA Experience immerses you in a captivating visual and musical universe, presented upon one of the most sublime canvases imaginable: the French-inspired, Gothic Revival architectural interior of Notre-Dame Basilica of Montréal. The light and music show was quite an experience.  It was little loud for Camilla, so I covered her ears with my hands while she hummed along. After a hot day of walking around Montreal and often carrying Camilla, I had a migraine that lasted through the night.  Finally after 6am the next morning I had some relief – possibly helped by seeing this restful face.

Of course, all the signs were now in French and distance and speed are listed as kilometers and kilometers per hour, respectively.  We arrived at downtown Montreal by crossing this bridge.

(5 seconds) We stopped at a rest stop. We caught a glimpse of some of the sights of Washington, D. C.  In Maryland we drove through the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and saw this chimney.  Google Maps had many issues with an instability in switching routes around New York City possibly due to changing traffic around the George Washington Bridge and the Maryland/Delaware route. One example was that Google Maps suggested a route to exit a highway and then immediately re-enter the highway to avoid a 23min delay on a small bridge. However, the road for the detour no longer allows you to re-enter the highway without driving around the block and contending with additional traffic. This is the Maw of blackholes that sucked up a half hour to lead us back to the highway behind the same truck we were behind when we left it. The one benefit was we did get to see Minnesota Ave. ;) Camilla thought these powerlines looked like cats. :) Grabbed lunch at the Joe Biden rest stop in Delaware. Linda was happy to see a Weeping Willow tree, which we don’t see often in Florida.  We saw the New York City skyline as we drove through New Jersey and then continued past some beautiful homes in Englewood, NJ before finally navigating or way to the Cuomo bridge to cross towards White Plains and on to Stamford.  When we arrived in Stamford, CT Camilla got to see her cousins Emily and Sarah and her Aunt and Uncle Julie and Brian.

The house was modeled after the King’s House in Salisbury, England.  Edith was an Art History major and the house has many paintings on display. The painter with the most paintings in the house was Ghent, who seemed to paint in a blurry style, so I didn’t take any pictures of her work ;P. Photos of other paintings are below. Head of a Girl painting (below). Saint Catherine of Alexandria’ painting (below). Saint Catherine’s miracle was that after being sentenced to a slow death by spiked roller, the torture device’s wheel broke and beheaded her so she received an instantaneous death.  The Tennis Players painting.  Some brands of Weeks businesses included Armand and Weeks &amp; Leo Co.  The house was built for $150,000, but cost about $3,000,000 to finish and decorate (which is equivalent to about $40,000,000 at the time the poster I read was created). Here are some pics of the bathrooms.     One of Carl’s businesses was one of the first companies to refuse to sell its products to shops that would offer discounts on their products.

One kitten (the gold one) will have her name changed from Goldie to Ziti when she moves to her new home. The black &amp; white kitten has been named Frankie Jr. (after our black &amp; white dog, Frankie), Jimmy, and most recently Teddy. The three color kitten has been consistently named Ivory.      The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,    It isn’t just one of your holiday games; You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.  First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,    Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—    All of them sensible everyday names.  There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,    Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames: Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—    But all of them sensible everyday names, But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,    A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified, Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,    Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride? Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,    Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat, Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—    Names that never belong to more than one cat.  But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,    And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover—    But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.  When you notice a cat in profound meditation,    The reason, I tell you, is always the same: His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation    Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:      His ineffable effable      Effanineffable Deep and inscrutable singular name.

And then tried to burn some energy twirling before starting our last long car ride.  We stopped at the Florida Welcome Center to use the restroom and inquire about the advertised cheap amusement park tickets, but, passed on the deals since it required viewing a time share presentation. However, we did see this humungous banana spider outside the building.  Later we stopped at Panera for our last lunch on the road fifty miles from Camilla City.  Finally we arrived home, unpacked, retrieved all the pets, and a week later were able to take this family photo for Camilla to bring to school for her new VPK class.  "

Our non-binding agreement to stop at the American Gothic House, Hannibal Mark Twain statue, and the St. Loius Arch was over-ruled by the driver. I did capture a slightly better drive-by picture of the Arch compared to the one I got on the way north.  We arrived at the hotel in enough time to enjoy the swimming pool and hot tub before bed.  "

We saw a bass like we used to have in a fish tank.  We also saw some animals that live near water that reminded me of Minnesota.   Camilla tried to win something at a pull-up contest.  Giant Slide!

Sometimes Camilla did some drawing.  Sometimes she didn’t know what to draw.  She didn’t let us do much napping.  We saw many tunnels on our way to Denver.       At some point we went to dinner.

Linda had paid for the bus tickets online by phone, but, it didn’t seem like the bus driver cared to confirm payment, since we just walked on.  We drove north to a restaurant near Washington State University to go to lunch.  We drove around near the campus for an hour siteseeing and failing to find a parking spot to get out and explore the area on foot.  Getting stuck waiting for the bridge made us decide to cut the driving tour short so we could get gas and make it to the restuarant on time.  After lunch, we headed south towards Portland.

    "body": "2021/07/27 - The plan for our third day was to make an early trip to the city lakes for a walk before meeting family and friends for dinner that evening. While driving to Uptown along Lake Street, I tried to take in all that has changed in the years since I lived in the area.  Moving at thirty mph was too fast to have time to focus on either the new construction on the west end of Lake Street, or the George Floyd murals on the easts end of Lake Street.  Hopefully once we get to the west coast we’ll find more time for the sights than a quick driveby. The first sight that caught Linda’s attention when we turned onto Lake Street from Hiawatha, was the bum of a man on the corner whose pants were hanging way too low. After finding parking north of Lagoon near my old apartment, I was disoriented when trying to find the Bruegger’s Bagel shop on Lake – which unbeknownst to me had been sold five years earlier for new development.  As a result, we ended up at Barbette’s for breakfast, since it was the only place nearby that was open.  Afterwards, we walked to the first playground around Bde Maka Ska (previously known as Lake Calhoun) before surrendering to the heat.  The park and lake were very active with runners, walkers, sailors, and stand up paddle boarders, but there were signs indicating that swimming was prohibited due to the presence of bacteria.  As we left the lakes, we drove around to find a cousin’s new house, but I kept getting confused trying to enter the correct address into google maps.  Eventually, Linda recognized the house from a picture she had seen briefly months earlier as we drove by. On the way back from the lakes, we found a Bruegger’s Bagel shop in Edina and stopped for lunch.  Once again, we found that indoor dining wasn’t available, so we brought the food back to Chris’ home. At Aunt Christine’s, the squirrels were brave enough to pilfer the seeds she set out for them from a tray, but, not brave enough to approach Linda when she attempted to offer one seeds from her hand.  We also saw a black squirrel in a tree, which I don’t recall having seen before.  The white squirrel that had come to Chris’ deck in the past is no longer around.  We ended the day with pizza at Carbones at an event Chris planned to get anyone together to catch up during our short visit and to meet Linda and Camilla.  The kids started quietly coloring, and soon started playing ring-around-the-rosie and puppy/kitty games.  By the end of the evening, Camilla’s knees were filthy from playing the role of the puppy as she crawled on the floor.   "

    "body": "2021/07/26 - Driving from Keokuk to St. Paul with a stop in Des Moines completed the final day of our three day trek from Oviedo to the Twin Cities. Linda enjoyed being reminded that Iowa isn’t always the cold gray state that she remembers, and was elated to see the county highways lined by wildflowers and to have a chance to see varieties of plants and wildlife that are rare (if present at all) in Florida, like the red winged blackbird.  While we stopped to look around, we were passed by a truck hauling an enourmous windmill blade.  Our route passed the American Gothic House, which we had seen on a previous road trip.  It is closed on Mondays, so, we just posed for some pictures outside and admired the wildflower gardens in the surrounding area.  In Des Moines, we picked up a rental car and left my car at Linda’s sister’s house so we’d have a ride back to Oviedo when our travels to the west on Amtrak conclude in Osceola IA in a few weeks.  We had Brueggar’s Bagels sandwiches for lunch with Camilla’s Uncle Russ and Aunt Lori while Camilla got to see their two cats.  On the way up 35N to St. Paul, Linda showed Camilla cattails at the Iowa Welcome Center near the border with Minnesota.  We also saw many windmills with blades like the one we saw on the flatbead earlier in the day.  Once we arrived at Aunt Christine’s place in West St. Paul, Camilla went right back to work drawing while we enjoyed being outside listening to the birds without the Florida heat and humidity.   Cats are intended to teach us that not everything in nature has a purpose.  Garrison Keillor"

    "title": "Out On The Road",
    "body": "2021/07/25 - A full day of driving brings us to Keokuk, IA. Lot’s of screen time for Camilla today again as we travelled in six states in one day (and Tennessee twice)! [TN, GA, TN, KY, IL, MO, IA].  In Peducah, we ate lunch in a quiet cemetary next to a subway (again with the lobby closed due to staff shortages).  We were suprised by how short some of the lives seemed as listed on the headstones.  Like the French brothers who died in 1962 at 21 and 27 years old, and all the people who died after only 30-70 years. Driving through the country we see lots of beautiful scenic areas, but, it’s hard to take pictures from the car.  Here’s one from our stop in Peducah. We have a non-binding agreement that we will stop at the St. Louis arch or somewhere with a good view of it on our way back south.  Camilla may have seen it as we drove by quickly. We may also stop in Hannibal to see Mark Twain on our drive south, too. Eventually, we arrived in Keokuk (again, too late to swim).  Maybe someday.  She was not quite what you would call refined. She was not quite what you would call unrefined. She was the kind of person that keeps a parrot.  Mark Twain"

    "title": "Hurry Up and Wait",
    "body": "2021/07/24 - One day of driving complete and two more to go on the first stretch of our journey. It didn’t take long for Camilla to get started watching videos. She also spent some time coloring and singing about space and the states. She is going to get a lot of carseat time this trip.  It took three stops before everyone had breakfast on the road since some restaurants’ lobbies were closed due to being short staffed.  The drive-thrus lines looked too long to wait.  Eventually we decided we’d just have to wait so we could get back on the road.  Hopefully tomorrow’s route doesn’t have traffic like we found going through Atlanta – which added an hour and a half to our expected drive time.  We were on the road (including only short stops) for twelve hours (9. 5 hours expected drive time).  No time for the pool, but, we took a little walk to get a snack by our hotel before the sun was down.  Some highlights of the drive were seeing a truck full of watermelons, which reminded me immediately of the Sonny and Cher hour episode with the Bionic Watermellon, and imagining a watermellon falling from the truck.  And then it happened. Right before our eyes.  I’d post a link to the video, but, after rewatching it, it really isn’t worth your time. We also saw a truck emblazoned with the word Serenity, which reminded me of Seinfeld and how to deal with being stuck in traffic.  Serenity Now!  Seinfeld"

    "body": "2021/07/23 - Tomorrow we set sail for unknown shores as the first day of our month long trip across the country begins. We’ll be leaving Florida the day after Camilla celebrated Christmas in July on her last day of school with her class.  When we return from vacation, she will begin VPK in a new class at the same school.  The first leg of our travels has us driving north for three days with hotel stops in Ooltewah, TN and Keokuk, IA on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Over the next four weeks, highlights will include seeing family in Des Moines, the Twin Cities, Seattle, and Berkley while we explore the western half of the United States by train.  If we find time, we’ll post updates to this blog. Let the adventure begin!  We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.  T. S. Eliot"
