We drove quickly past many wineries and noticed some names that we recognized like Kendall Jackson Winery, Francis Ford Coppola Winery, and Nelson Family Vineyards but didn’t get any pictures.  We passed Vallejo.  Once we got near San Francisco we saw the black smoke in the sky for the first time on our trip. We’re not sure if this smoke was from a fire or not. Previously we only saw gray hazy sky when we thought we were near fires.  We passed Alcatraz, saw the San Francisco skyline, and crossed over a famous bridge.   And finally arrived at our hotel.

Saw a waterfall and coi pond.  And the bridge.  And the view of Portland.  Before leaving through the bamboo alley (guarded by lions).  And checking out the bonsai garden.   At Cannon Beach it was a bit rainy and crowded with tourists, so we didn’t stay long after hunting down a sweet treat at a chocolate store.  "

I made it down to one of the two village restaurants that are open in the morning for coffee.  I saw these flowers on the way back up the hillside.  And that was the only picture for the day.

As we left the hotel, we met a robot cleaning the hallway carpet.  Beep, Boop.  We walked to a bus stop to get a ride to the rental car.  I carried the car seat, so we glad I had found a slight short cut up the King Street Station stairs to the bus stop about two blocks away.  Linda had paid for the bus tickets online by phone, but, it didn’t seem like the bus driver cared to confirm payment, since we just walked on.  We drove north to a restaurant near Washington State University to go to lunch.  We drove around near the campus for an hour siteseeing and failing to find a parking spot to get out and explore the area on foot.  Getting stuck waiting for the bridge made us decide to cut the driving tour short so we could get gas and make it to the restuarant on time.  After lunch, we headed south towards Portland.  And then west to Oceanside.  Which sent us through a tunnel under some homes.  Down some hills (and apparently up some, too).  We arrived before a late sunset.

    "body": "2021/07/27 - The plan for our third day was to make an early trip to the city lakes for a walk before meeting family and friends for dinner that evening. While driving to Uptown along Lake Street, I tried to take in all that has changed in the years since I lived in the area.  Moving at thirty mph was too fast to have time to focus on either the new construction on the west end of Lake Street, or the George Floyd murals on the easts end of Lake Street.  Hopefully once we get to the west coast we’ll find more time for the sights than a quick driveby. The first sight that caught Linda’s attention when we turned onto Lake Street from Hiawatha, was the bum of a man on the corner whose pants were hanging way too low. After finding parking north of Lagoon near my old apartment, I was disoriented when trying to find the Bruegger’s Bagel shop on Lake – which unbeknownst to me had been sold five years earlier for new development.  As a result, we ended up at Barbette’s for breakfast, since it was the only place nearby that was open.  Afterwards, we walked to the first playground around Bde Maka Ska (previously known as Lake Calhoun) before surrendering to the heat.  The park and lake were very active with runners, walkers, sailors, and stand up paddle boarders, but there were signs indicating that swimming was prohibited due to the presence of bacteria.  As we left the lakes, we drove around to find a cousin’s new house, but I kept getting confused trying to enter the correct address into google maps.  Eventually, Linda recognized the house from a picture she had seen briefly months earlier as we drove by. On the way back from the lakes, we found a Bruegger’s Bagel shop in Edina and stopped for lunch.  Once again, we found that indoor dining wasn’t available, so we brought the food back to Chris’ home. At Aunt Christine’s, the squirrels were brave enough to pilfer the seeds she set out for them from a tray, but, not brave enough to approach Linda when she attempted to offer one seeds from her hand.  We also saw a black squirrel in a tree, which I don’t recall having seen before.  The white squirrel that had come to Chris’ deck in the past is no longer around.  We ended the day with pizza at Carbones at an event Chris planned to get anyone together to catch up during our short visit and to meet Linda and Camilla.  The kids started quietly coloring, and soon started playing ring-around-the-rosie and puppy/kitty games.  By the end of the evening, Camilla’s knees were filthy from playing the role of the puppy as she crawled on the floor.   "

Linda enjoyed being reminded that Iowa isn’t always the cold gray state that she remembers, and was elated to see the county highways lined by wildflowers and to have a chance to see varieties of plants and wildlife that are rare (if present at all) in Florida, like the red winged blackbird.  While we stopped to look around, we were passed by truck hauling an enourmous windmill blade.  Our route passed the American Gothic House, which we had seen on a previous road trip.  It is closed on Mondays, so, we just posed for some pictures outside and admired the wildflower gardens in the surrounding area.  In Des Moines, we picked up a rental car and left my car at Linda’s sister’s house so we’d have a ride back to Oviedo when our travels to the west on Amtrak conclude in Osceola IA in a few weeks.  We had Brueggar’s Bagels sandwiches for lunch with Camilla’s Uncle Russ and Aunt Lori while Camilla got to see their two cats.  On the way up 35N to St. Paul, Linda showed Camilla cattails at the Iowa Welcome Center near the border with Minnesota.  We also saw many windmills with blades like the one we saw on the flatbead earlier in the day.  Once we arrived at Aunt Christine’s place in West St. Paul, Camilla went right back to work drawing while we enjoyed being outside listening to the birds without the Florida heat and humidity.

Like the French brothers who died in 1962 at 21 and 27 years old, and all the people who died after only 30-70 years. Driving through the country we see lots of beautiful scenic areas, but, it’s hard to take pictures from the car.  Here’s one from our stop in Peducah. We have a non-binding agreement that we will stop at the St. Louis arch or somewhere with a good view of it on our way back south.  Camilla may have seen it as we drove by quickly. We may also stop in Hannibal to see Mark Twain on our drive south, too. Eventually, we arrived in Keokuk (again, too late to swim).  Maybe someday.  She was not quite what you would call refined. She was not quite what you would call unrefined. She was the kind of person that keeps a parrot. Mark Twain "

    "body": "2021/07/24 - One day of driving complete and two more to go on the first stretch of our journey. It didn’t take long for Camilla to get started watching videos. She also spent some time coloring and singing about space and the states. She is going to get a lot of carseat time this trip.  It took three stops before everyone had breakfast on the road since some restaurants’ lobbies were closed due to being short staffed.  The drive-thrus lines looked too long to wait.  Eventually we decided we’d just have to wait so we could get back on the road.  Hopefully tomorrow’s route doesn’t have traffic like we found going through Atlanta – which added an hour and a half to our expected drive time.  We were on the road (including only short stops) for twelve hours (9. 5 hours expected drive time).  No time for the pool, but, we took a little walk to get a snack by our hotel before the sun was down.  Some highlights of the drive were seeing a truck full of watermelons, which reminded me immediately of the Sonny and Cher hour episode with the Bionic Watermellon, and imagining a watermellon falling from the truck.  And then it happened. Right before our eyes.  I’d post a link to the video, but, after rewatching it, it really isn’t worth your time. We also saw a truck emblazoned with the word Serenity, which reminded me of Seinfeld and how to deal with being stuck in traffic.  Serenity Now!Seinfeld "

    "body": "2021/07/23 - Tomorrow we set sail for unknown shores as the first day of our month long trip across the country begins. We’ll be leaving Florida the day after Camilla celebrated Christmas in July on her last day of school with her class.  When we return from vacation, she will begin VPK in a new class at the same school.  The first leg of our travels has us driving north for three days with hotel stops in Ooltewah, TN and Keokuk, IA on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Over the next four weeks, highlights will include seeing family in Des Moines, the Twin Cities, Seattle, and Berkley while we explore the western half of the United States by train.  If we find time, we’ll post updates to this blog. Let the adventure begin!  We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. T. S. Eliot "
