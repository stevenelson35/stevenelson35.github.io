The plan for our third day was to make an early trip to the city lakes for a walk before meeting family and friends for dinner that evening.

While driving to Uptown along Lake Street, it was difficult to take in all that has changed in the years since I lived in the area.  At thirty mph, it was hard to fully focus on either the gradual changes in new developments on the west end of Lake Street, or the George Floyd murals on the easts end of Lake Street.  The first sight that caught Linda's attention when we turned onto Lake Street from Hiawatha, was the bum of a man on the corner whose pants were hanging a bit low.

After finding parking at the mall north of Lagoon near my old apartment, I was disoriented when trying to find the Bruegger's Bagel shop on Lake -- which had been sold five years earlier for new development.  As a result, we ended up at Barbette on Lake for breakfast instead, since it was the only place nearby that was opened.  There we were able to eat at a table on the street.
