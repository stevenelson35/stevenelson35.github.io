Today we departed the California Zephyr in Osceola Iowa.  

We slept on the train a little better than the night before, but, not great.

Camilla played around on the sleeper car bench one last time.

And Linda took one last look out the train window while avoiding being directly photographed.

The train made a quick stop for us to depart, since Osceola is an unmanned depot. This is also why we were not able to check any luggage in the baggage car for this route.

The next stop was Bruegger's Bagels for breakfast.

Later Camilla played in a park while Linda went shopping at a nearby HyVee.
