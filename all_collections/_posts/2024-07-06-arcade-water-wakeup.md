Woke up early to get wet and play Magic Quest and go to the arcade.  

Camilla loves Magic Quest, which she played last year.  It involves walking around each floor of the hotel and pointing a wand at various items to proceed through the quest to ultimately fight a dragon.  This quest was in the land of **Vellara**.  Here's a map:

Camilla is ready for the quest with her wand and wolf ears.

This is how you point a wand.

There are many wands you can select from the store with various *upgrades*.

Often you have to go to a kiosk to get directions for what to find next as you progress through the stages of the quest.

Defeating the dragon was difficult and took Linda's expert skills.
