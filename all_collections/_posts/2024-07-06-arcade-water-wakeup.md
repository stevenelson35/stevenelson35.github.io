Woke up early to get wet and play Magic Quest and go to the arcade.  

Camilla loves Magic Quest. She played it fof the first time last year at the Great Wolf Lodge in Niagara. It involves walking around each floor of the hotel and pointing a wand at various items to proceed through the quest to ultimately fight a dragon.  This quest was in the land of **Vellara**.  Here's a map:

Camilla is ready for the quest with her wand and wolf ears.

This is how you point a wand.

There are many wands you can select from the store with various *upgrades*.

Often you have to go to a kiosk to get directions for what to find next as you progress through the stages of the quest.

We enjoy the quest with Camilla because you walk alot as you traverse the three floors (usually using the stairs) to repeatedly pass through each hallway where the game items are on display.  Some highlights from the quest are in the pictures below.

The first major challenge we faced was learning the code to activate the dragon. After struggling to select the symbols in the correct order to crack the code, another guest pointed out that the code symbol order is revealed when you activate the the dragon picture on a lower floor. You just hat pay attention to the order that the lights are
 lit. However, once you've activated the dragon paiinting, you cannot see the clue again. Fortunately, someone told us the order so we could continue the quest.

Defeating the dragon was difficult and took Linda's expert skills.

It took many attempts, but, eventually Linda figured out how to help Camilla defeat the dragon and finish the quest.

Camilla made the leader board displayed on the wall.

Later we played some arcade games. Camilla likes to race the motor bikes.

I couldn't find a good song reference for the day, so, since we woke up and defeated a fire breathing dragon and played in an arcade, I thought that maybe this song with David Bowie is appropriate by title alone.  Also, I think Linda likes Arcade Fire. Maybe.
