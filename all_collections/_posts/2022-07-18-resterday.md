Monday was a day of rest.

My apologies in advance for creating a blog post on a day where nothing much happened.  Perhaps these pictures of Camilla and some flowers will suffice.

We left the house around 2pm today to get a late lunch and go shopping.

As we left the house, Camilla explored the large Hibiscus-like flowers in the front yard while we waited for everyone to be ready to leave.

Camilla got two dresses and a pink bow headband at the mall.
