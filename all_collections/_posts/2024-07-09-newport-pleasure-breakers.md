We toured *The Breakers* and cliff walk on our first full day in Newport, Rhode Island.    

We walked to a nice, cheap, small Greek diner for breakfast. On the way back to our hotel, we walked along streets with old houses, flowers, and a community garden.

The park behind the garden had an elephant statue from India representing a specific elephant. We would see more of these elephants at other locations around Newport.

Camilla Posed by a restaurant near our hotel.

Whenever we walked back to the hotel, Camilla would hide along the columns.

We parked on a side street near *The Breakers* and walked to the famous house.  

At first, we started to walk to a university by mistake.

Then we headed for *The Beakers* along a sidewalk near a mossy fence.

![Linda and Camilla in Front of The Breakers]({{ site.pics_url }}20240721_113308.jpg)  

The main room of *The Breakers* was huge with a painted ceiling. Chairs had been placed for a music concert on the main floor. There were numerous events around Newport this summer showcasing music at different venues.

Behind a grand stairway to the left of the main room was a fountain and sitting area. Linda said this might be her favorite place to sleep here because she could hear the sound of the water.  

![Stairs Fountain]({{ site.pics_url }}20240721_113659.jpg)  

The left room looked like this.  

![Breakers Left Room]({{ site.pics_url }}20240721_113758.jpg)  

The walls often had paintings of the family members and symbols that were meaningful to the family.

Acorns and oak leaves were important symbols representing strength and longevity and appear on the family crest.

Here is Gladys Moore Vanderbilt.

The room on the right of the main room included a piano and was where someone got married.  

![Breakers Piano Room]({{ site.pics_url }}20240709_110842.jpg)  

Upstairs were bedrooms for the family.  

Some rooms had old phones like this.  

![Old Phone]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_075308.jpg)  

The bedrooms for the family typically had bathrooms with two tubs.  

The main bath tub had four knobs to control water. These supplied hot and cold fresh water as well as hot and cold salt water.  

![Bath Tub]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_075810.jpg)  

The family members often changed clothes up to seven times a day, bathing between changing, and possibly napping. To bath the lower half to freshen up, they could use these smaller soaking tubs.  

![Lower Half Bath]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_075723.jpg)  

Some servants could freshen clothes in the closets, prepare the bath, and change the bedding (multiple times a day) using hidden passageways.  They could be contacted using a call system which activated indicators on a panel.

There was a great open patio off the main floor from which you could see the back yard and ocean below the cliffs.

Outside there was a herd of elephants from India like the one we saw walking back from breakfast earlier in the day.

![Linda and Camilla with Elephant]({{ site.pics_url }}20240710_062528.jpg)  

The backyard bordered the cliffs to the sea. On the other side of the fence was a *The Clif Walk* which extends a few miles along the coast.

![Steve and Camilla with Elephant]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_081419.jpg)  

The side of the house had a mossy railing.  

![Mossy Railing]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_081501.jpg)  

We walked back around the front of the house to exit and follow the road on the right of the house down to *The Cliff Walk* so we could walk in front of *The Breakers* and eventually reach the park near our car.  

![Camilla and Linda Walking in The Breakers Front Yard]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_081543.jpg)  

There were a lot of wild flowers along the path outside the grounds.  

![White Flower]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_081819.jpg)  

We looked over the sea from the cliffs.

![Cliffs]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_081922.jpg)  

Linda and Camilla Walked down forty steps to the see from the park along *The Cliff Walk*.

![Linda and Camilla]({{ site.pics_url }}20240724_082434.jpg)  

Camilla pondered many things looking down to the sea.

Once we got back to our hotel, we walked to the marina to see some birds, flowers, and the *Lobster Shack*.  

The seagulls were surprisingly large compared to what we see at the beaches in Florida.

Later we drove to a store across from the International Tennis Hall of Fame Museum. We didn't look inside, but, recognized it by all the flags near the entrance.
