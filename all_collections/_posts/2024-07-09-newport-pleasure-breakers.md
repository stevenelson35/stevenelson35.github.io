We toured *The Breakers* and cliff walk on our first full day in Newport, Rhode Island.    


We walked to a nice, cheap, small Greek diner for breakfast. On the way back to our hotel, we walked along streets with old houses, flowers, and a community garden.

The park behind the garden had an elephant statue from India representing a specific elephant. We would see more of these elephants at other locations around Newport.

Whenever we walked back to the hotel, Camilla would hide along the columns.

We parked on a side street near *The Breakers* and walked to the famous house.  

At first, we started to walk to a university by mistake.

Then we headed for *The Beakers* along a sidewalk near a mossy fence.

Behind a grand stairway to the left of the main room was a fountain and sitting area. Linda said this might be her favorite place to sleep here because she could hear the sound of the water.
