Today's the Fourth of July.  

After a hotel breakfast at Embassy Suites, we were on our way to Williamsburg.  

We stopped at a rest stop.

And finally got to the *Great Wolf Lodge*.

Checked in.

And inspected the waterpark to have an idea what was in store for tomorrow.

It rained a bit and we weren't sure if there would be a full fire works display in Williamsburg or not due to weather.  We heard a few explosions, but didn't see anything from the hotel.  

Camilla wasn't interested in fireworks anyway.  Instead, she enjoyed some popcorn and tablet time :).
