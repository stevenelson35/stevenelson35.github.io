Once we got home we unpacked and posed for a pic with our pets the next day.  

Camilla posed while I setup the camera tripod.

Linda and Camilla gathered Teddy and Ivory.

Then I tried to encourage Frankie to join the photo and jump into the frame before all the pets decided they had matters of consequence to attend to.
