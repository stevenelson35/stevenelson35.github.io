The day after we got home we unpacked and posed for a pic with our pets.  

Camilla posed while I setup a phone on a tripod.

Linda and Camilla held Ivory while I looked for Teddy to hand to Linda.

Then I tried to encourage Frankie to join the photo and jump into the frame before all the pets decided they had matters of consequence to attend to. That gave us time for a single timed photo. My smile is provided by FaceApp<sup>TM</sup> :).
