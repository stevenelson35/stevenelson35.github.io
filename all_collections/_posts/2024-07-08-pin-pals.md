After the Master Magi ceremony, we played ten pin bowling before continuing our drive to the northeast.

We tried to get a final family pic in front of the water park, but, Camilla wasn't in the mood for pictures.

So we took a few parent pics.

Ten pin bowling was fun. It's like a scaled down version of the bowling we're used to. The ball is smaller and doesn't have any holes in it.

Camilla used her wand to help us pack up the car before beginning our drive.

We tried to give our Wolf pass to another family to use any benefits we hadn't used, but, the intent may have been lost in translation. We did get a family pic after we checked out as we walked to the car.

We passed the birthplace of George Washington and saw this sign.

We also saw this cloud.

Originally we planned to stay another day and have a long day of driving on Monday. However, we already had plenty of time at the lodge to do what we wanted and it was too hot to explore the old Williamsburg, so we left a day early to get a start on our drive.   

With the early departure, instead of trying to drive straight through to Newport, RI, we took a leaisurely drive to Delaware for the night.

We stopped in Newark, DE for the night. Linda thought that although it was very hot on our trip north, that the days seemed to be getting shorter. Actually, the daylight hours were actually a bit longer in Newark than in Oviedo on this day.
