We quickly packed and headed to Winter Park to pick up Camilla early from camp to start our summer vacation.  

Camilla was exicted to go to camp at the Art Museum for a short week before our vacation.

On July 3rd, we picked her up a few minutes early from camp to get on the road.

I was given one chance to get a pre-vacation family photo before leaving the Orlando Museum of Art.  Here it is ;).

Nobody was interested in taking a pre-vacation family photo, but, instead just wanted to get down to business and start driving.
