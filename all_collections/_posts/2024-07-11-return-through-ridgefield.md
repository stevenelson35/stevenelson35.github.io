On our way south we detoured towards Hartford to Danbury and Ridgefield with a stop in Stamford for lunch with Camilla's cousins.  

Before leaving Newport, I took in a few sites.

Camilla wanted to go to the fitness center in the hotel. Wimbeldon was on the TV.

Linda finished packing.

And may have packed the shells she found yesterday.

And then we were on our way!

The bridge off the island was foggy.

One small town we drove through in Connecticut had a McDonalds with an older arch sign. We did not eat there.

One small city we stopped for a restroom in was near Sandy Hook.  

Once we got to Danbury we saw the familiar mall intersection with Dick's and LL Bean (not shown).

We took a detour up Pine Mountain Road to see what that was like, since from google maps it looks like a great place to have a house near large forests. The road didn't look very inviting in person, though.  

We drove from Danbury through Ridgefield to Stamford. Along the way we drove around Ridge Field High School.

We recognized this Ridgefield Veterinary that may not be operational.

And saw this shoe in Ridgefield.

Finally we made it to Stamford for lunch at the `Parkway Diner`. We talked a lot about Emily's plans for college. The waitress had a daughter that was attending a college.
