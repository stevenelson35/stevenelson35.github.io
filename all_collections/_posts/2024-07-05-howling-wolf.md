We started our first full day at the Great Wolf Lodge with waterslides!

First Camilla posed in the Wolf seat.

And somewhere I saw this two color flower.

Camilla surprised us by wanting to go on the **scariest** water slide, the **Tornado!**  

She was tall enough for the ride, but, that was a big change from last year when she stuck to the kiddie slides.  

Although we didn't get much pictures of the slides, here is the outside of the **Tornado** as seen from our hotel room.  

This ride seats up to four people in a tube. First Camilla went with me. Later, we went a second time with Linda as well.

Throughout the day we alternated between the wave pool, the hot tub, and slides.

Camilla tried nearly every slide in the park. She even tried the body board surf simulator where you jump off a platform onto a body board and ride it down a wall of water.
