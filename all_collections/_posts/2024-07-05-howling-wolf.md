We started our first full day at the Great Wolf Lodge with waterslides!

First Camilla posed in the Great Wolf Lodge chair.

And somewhere I saw this blurry multi-color flower.

Camilla surprised us by wanting to go on the *scariest* water slide: the **Tornado!**  

She was tall enough for the ride, but, wanting to go on the -**Tornado** was a big change from last year when she stuck to the kiddie slides.  

Although we didn't get many pictures of the slides, I did get this. picture of the outside of the **Tornado** as seen from our hotel room which shows the shape of a feature that gives the slide its name. It is mostly pretty dark in the **Tornado*". 

The **Tornado** seats up to four people on a tube. Linda skipped the slide on our first voyage. That way we'd be sure to have one survivor to return to Oviedo to tell the tale of our daring adventure to our pets if things went didn't go as planned. Later, we went a second time with Linda as well.

Throughout the day we alternated between the wave pool, the hot tub, and slides.

Camilla tried nearly every slide in the park.  

She even tried the body board surf simulator. For that, you jump off a platform onto a body board and ride it down a wall of water. It islike you are body surfing down the face of a large, continuous wave. Camilla's swim lessons have definitely given her some courage when it comes to playing in the water.
