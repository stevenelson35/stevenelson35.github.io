A long day of driving took us from Newark, DE through Stamdford, CT and Wilton, CT before arriving in Newport, RI.  

Some sights along the way included this bridge.

And periodically symbols like this. Apparently this indicates where a crossing occurs in the freeway for emergency vehicles.

We went to a rest stop where there were some flowers.

We recognized Stamford by the building with the *W* on it. Maybe wrestling?

Camilla waved to Aunt Julie from the car as we drove through Stamford while Julie was at work.

We drove through the town of Wilton, CT to checkout the area and have lunch at *The Little Pub* in Wilton. We had been to a different *The Little Pub* the year before in Greenwich.

It was time for dinner when we got to Newport, so we walked to dinner past this bank.

Along the way walked under a tree that had branches growing downward that were trimmed about head height.

The low evening sun made for interesting shadows.

The restaurant we went to had sailing and buffalo decorations on the walls.

There was a familiar ice cream shop, *Kilwins*, that we recognized from Winter Park.

We stopped for ice cream.

On the way back to the hotel we walked out to view the harbor and saw this symbol of *Hope* on the ground.

A bell was on display that was the biggest cast bell in all the lands.  Here it is.
