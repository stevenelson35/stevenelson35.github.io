We explored Sachuest Point and a topiary garden.  

Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge has 2.5 miles of nature trails bordering a rocky shore and beach. It is a small penninsula off of the Aquidneck Island where Newport is found. When looking at a map, Camilla suggested it looks like an ostrich. The grassy park is home to many deer, rabbits, and birds.  

The entrance to the trail had a sign clearly warning of ticks.

The first animal we saw was a pheasant. Just a few feet down the trail in plain sight.

It didn't take long to see deer in the field.

Although it was a short walk, Camilla still likes to be carried whenever she can convince someone to pick her up.

Unless she is looking for animals on the ground.

Maybe she was looking at these snail shells.

Bunnies were also easy to find along the trail.

We followed one trail to the rocky shore.

Occasionally there was a rock that looked different than the other rocks.

Linda always likes to look for creatures. She found some.

One deer had antlers.

The deer sometimes walked right along the path after we passed.

There were always sounds of different birds to look for in the trees.

Apparently the bunnies had been busy creating more bunnies. They were abundant.

After our walk, the wildlife center was open. We used the restrooms and talked to the volunteer about the refuge and life on the island. After raising kids on the island, she had moved to southeast Florida for a bit. Now she spends time in the northeast with trips to St. Augustine, FL instead of southeast FL.

We passed a windmill on the way to the topiary gardens.

We also passed this tree.  It may have been asking the question that Linda has on her mind: "Y are you taking so many pictures?"

At the topiary garden, Linda quickly spotted this tick.

We found a rock that gave a little better view of the sea over the wall at the edge of the topiary site.  

Camilla likes to look out into the distance. What is she thinking about?

There was a big old tree near the house at the topiary site.

Camilla and Linda posed on the rock. It was a quiet space in the shade with a nice view.
