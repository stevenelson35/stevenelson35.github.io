And then Camilla turned `Seven`!  

After seeing that she got her most important birthday gift that I assemebled the night before (a cat tree), she went to start her day with some gaming.  This time she thought to ask for donations -- possibly thinking that because it was her birthday someone would give her roblox money (see sign in pic below).

Oh, here's the cat tree she got as a gift.

We had gymnastics class.

At the gymnastics studio, the building is covered with some moth caterpillars.

Although we are celebrating her birthday with friends at our house in two weeks, we marked the day with an early dinner at `The Melting Pot`.  She picked that restaurant because Linda had not picked it for her birthday this year.  I guess we need to go every year (?).  

After dinner Camilla wanted to pose with `Spot` from `Target`.
