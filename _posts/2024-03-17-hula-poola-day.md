The first day on Sanibel we relaxed around the house.  

Camilla opened some early gifts for her upcoming birthday.

After swimming in the pool, apparently, we drove somewhere. 

This was the first time my parents saw Linda's new Volvo XC60 Plugin Hybrid.

One gift Camilla enjoyed was a *hula hoop*!
