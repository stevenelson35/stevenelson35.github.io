title: Oceanside Day 2

In the morning, Linda and Camilla went to the beach and in the afternoon I joined them to go hiking at Cape Meare's Lighthouse.  

It was a foggy day with low clouds.

Camilla sat on a log.

A big log.

And Linda befriended a seagull that was missing a foot.

At the lighthouse, it was too foggy to see the ocean over the cliffs, so, we climbed some rocks.
