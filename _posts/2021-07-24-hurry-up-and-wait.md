title: Hurry Up and Wait
---
One day of driving complete and two more to go on the first stretch of our journey.

It didn't take long for Camilla to get started watching videos. She also spent some time coloring and singing about space and the states. She is going to get a lot of carseat time this trip.

It took three stops before everyone had breakfast on the road since some restaurants' lobbies were closed due to being short staffed.  The drive-thrus lines looked too long to wait.  Eventually we decided we'd just have to wait so we could get back on the road.

Hopefully tomorrow's route doesn't have traffic like we found going through Atlanta -- which added an ***hour and a half***  to our expected drive time.  We were on the road (including only short stops) for twelve hours (9.5 hours expected drive time).  No time for the pool, but, we took a little walk to get a snack by our hotel before the sun was down.

Some highlights of the drive were seeing a truck full of watermellons, which reminded my immediately of the Sonny and Cher hour episode with the Bionic Watermellon, and imagining a watermellon falling from the truck.  And then it happened. Right before our eyes.  I'd post a link to the video, but, after rewatching it, it really isn't worth your time.  

We also saw a truck emblazoned with the word *Serenity*, which reminded me of Seinfeld and how to deal with being stuck in traffic.

>Serenity Now!
