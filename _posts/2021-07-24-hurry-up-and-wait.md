One day of driving down and two more to go on the first stretch of our journey.

It didn't tak long for Camilla to get started watching videos. She also spent some time coloring and singing. She is going to get a lot of carseat time this trip.

It took three stops before everyone had breakfast since some restaurants' lobbies were closed due to being short staffed, resulting in long drive-thru lines.

Hopefully tomorrow's route doesn't have traffic like we found going through Atlanta -- which added an hour and a half to our expected drive time.  No time for the pool, but, we got a little walk in to get a snack by our hotel.
