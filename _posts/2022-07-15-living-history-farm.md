We spent the midday at Living History Farms.

The [Living History Farms](http://lhf.org 'Living History Farms') was near the home we rented in Urbandale, IA.

One home had some decorative tools used for flattening close (ironing) hanging on the wall.  The tools were likely functional at one time, but here they were a carved gift to a fiance, since the home depicted a period after the iron had been invented.

The main street in the town had buildings for drugs, a law office, and a millinery (pictured below).  There were also a bank, newspaper, general store, and a blacksmith.

A the end of the main street was a church.

Camilla liked talking to the Milliner in the building containing dual women-ownded businesses (milliner and hat maker).

We took a long tractor ride to a trail we could walk to see three farms from different ages.  We were most interested in finding some animals, which were in the last (1900) farm.  Along the way we say some bores.

We crossed a bridge.

And found a piglet names *Peanut* at the last farm.
