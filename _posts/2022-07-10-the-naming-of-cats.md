Pics of the kittens and us and notes on their *everyday names*.  

Each kitten has been named at least once by Camilla.  

One kitten (the gold one) will have her name changed from *Goldie* to *Ziti* when she moves to her new home. 

The black & white kitten has been named *Frankie Jr.* (after our black & white dog, *Frankie*), *Jimmy*, and most recently *Teddy*.

The three color kitten has been consistently named *Ivory*.

The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,  
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;  
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter  
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.  
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,  
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,  
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—  
     All of them sensible everyday names.  
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,  
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:  
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—  
     But all of them sensible everyday names,  
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,  
     A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,  
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,  
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?  
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,  
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,  
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—  
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.  
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,  
     And that is the name that you never will guess;  
The name that no human research can discover—  
     But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.  
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,  
     The reason, I tell you, is always the same:  
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation  
     Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:  
          His ineffable effable  
          Effanineffable  
Deep and inscrutable singular name.
