On Thursday and Friday Linda worked so Camilla and I played outside before going to the `Launch` trampoline park that evening.

We've been to launch a few times.  I have learned that I cannot go crazy on the trampolines anymore without paying for it the next day.  I do like to challenge myself and run up the warped wall each time we are there.  It seems nobody else ever seems to make it up.  I probably just make it up because I am old and wise ;).

Camilla was happy to see that by random chance her good friend was also at `Launch` that evening -- although they didn't immediately recognize each other while jumping on the same trampoline.
