Sunday afternoon we attended a surprise birthday party for Linda's sister at the [Madison County Winery](https://www.madisoncountywinery.com/ 'Madison County Windery').

The *Midnight Rain* is a fruit forward pinot noir-like wine.

Linda's sister Lori arrived at the surprise party after returning from a cruise.  Russ and her daughter's worked hard to keep the party a secret.

Sending out a blog update email to my (ten) subscribers could have potentially revealed the surprise, since it included posts detailing our days in Iowa before the party.  Fortunately, Lori has enough email that the blog update email wasn't found before the event.

The winery is in St. Charles, IA, which is near Winterset, IA --and Winterset is the town where John Wayne was born.
