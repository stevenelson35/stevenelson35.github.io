In Iowa we played indoor mini-putt, met baby Bowen, and Camilla made a snowman.  

In the morning when unplugging her car, Linda noticed that it appears that someone *keyed* her new car right above the electric plug connector. We figure it likely was the person in the large pickup that parked right next to her the night before at dinner where she had purposely parked in the farthest spaces in the lot away from all the other cars.  Not so Iowa nice :(.  

At *Pins and Putts* we played nine holes of indoor mini golf.

The putting game was point based instead of stroke based, with each hole getting 5000 bonus if you sink the first putt that which also placed the ball for your second putt near (or in) the final hole.

We saw baby Bowen for the first time and Camilla held him.

Earlier in the trip we saw snowfall and Camilla got to play in the snow. However, she had not built a snowman. In Iowa, there was no snow on the ground. However, Uncle Russ had saved snow for Camilla from last year in his freezer.

Camilla was able to use the saved snow for a quick snowball fight and to build two snowmen.

She even added a carrot nose.

And two eyes of kibble.
