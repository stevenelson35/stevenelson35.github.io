Linda's friend invited us to tour her friends chicken farm in Winter Springs.  

The day started after Linda finished work and we picked up Linda and Judy at the clinic where a moth was resting on the door.

Camilla got to see the clinic cats while we waited for Linda to finish up work.

The chicken farm is an educational farm called `Cluckn Something Somethin`.

There were chickens with many different appearances, like this fluffy head chicken.
