Camilla was anxious to get home to her cats.  

We had our last hotel breakfast before getting on the road for an easy final leg of our vacation being just 5.5 hours of drivetime at 9:30am.

Did it really take three hours to drive the remaining 65 miles to leave South Carolina?

Traffic was bad from the start of the day and didn't let up.  We attempted taking a few detours to avoid traffic when the map app suggested it, but, so did everyone else on the road.  I think the added stress of *Fourth Of July* weekend traffic compounded the driving slowdowns.  It took about nine hours travelling time with stops and (many) traffic slowdowns to get home.  

Eventually -- we made it home!

Camilla was excited to see her bedroom.  She danced. :)
