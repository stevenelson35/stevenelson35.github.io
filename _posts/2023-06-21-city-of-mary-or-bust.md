We drove to our first international destination Montreal, founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or "City of Mary".  

Montreal is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill around which the early city of Ville-Marie is built.  

Along our drive we stopped at a New York rest stop shop.

We saw some hills on the route north.

I saw a number of *blue jays* at a rest stop, but they would not stay still for a picture. I did get this picture of one of their homes instead, though.

Here is where we crossed the border to Canada.

But still had a ways to drive before reaching Montreal.  Of course, all the signs were now in French and distance and speed are listed as *kilometers* and *kilometers per hour*, respectively.

We arrived at downtown Montreal by crossing this bridge.

And stayed at an *Airbnb* in a luxury condo building which had posted in the elevator that *Airbnb* and related rental services are illegal.  Our host assured us she had an agreement with the condo board.
