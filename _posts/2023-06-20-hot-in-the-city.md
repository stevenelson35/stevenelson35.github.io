We spent a day at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC.  

Sarah and Camilla had to get up early for the day.

We took a taxi to the [American Museum of Natural History](http://amnh.org) and saw the *Davis Family Butterfly Vivarium*, the *Insectarium*, and *Worlds Beyond Earth* space show.

We also saw the *Allison and Roberto Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals* exhibit sponsored by Julie's prior boss and took a picture with the elephants.

After the museum, we walked across *Central Park* to and Camilla chased some pigeons even though her legs were tired.

We had dinner on the third floor of [Sarafina's Fabulous Pizza](https://www.serafinarestaurant.com/) before taking a taxi back to *Grand Central Station* for a train back to *Stamford* where Julie picked us up after a long, hot day.
