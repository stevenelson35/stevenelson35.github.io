Today we drove from Mount Vernon to Atlanta.  

Before leaving Mount Vernon, Linda fixed Camilla's hair for the ride on the unusual indoor deck of our hotel room.

Camilla took advantage of our gas station Subway lunch to do some stretches.

At our hotel near Atlanta I knew we were close to home as I saw the familiar behavior return that I've grown to accept as normal: girls with screens.
