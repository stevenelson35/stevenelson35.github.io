We ate fair food, saw animals, and rode fair rides at the Iowa State Fair. 

On the way to the fair, Linda saw a bunny struggling on the side of the road. We stopped and she helped it get around the curb and away from the street. 

Near the entrance we posed for pictures by the fair murals.   

We had lunch soon after arriving.  


Camilla got to see a lot of farm animals.  


She saw her beloved chickens.  


She wanted to pose behind the cutouts.  


We saw a bass like we used to have in a fish tank. 


We also saw some animals that live near water that reminded me of Minnesota. 

Then we stayed until Camilla rode most of the children's rides (even the little Dragon Wagon roller coaster).
