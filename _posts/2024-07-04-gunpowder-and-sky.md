Today's the Fourth of July.  

After a hotel breakfast at Embassy Suites, we were on our way to Williamsburg.

After checking in, we inspected the waterpark to have an idea what was in store for tomorrow.

It rained a bit and we weren't sure if there would be a full fire works display in Williamsburg or not due to weather.  We heard a few explosions, but didn't see anything from the hotel.  

Camilla wasn't interested in fireworks anyway.  Instead, she enjoyed some popcorn and table time.
