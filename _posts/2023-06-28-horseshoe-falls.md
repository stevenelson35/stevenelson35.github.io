We ventured out to the falls again for a *Behind the Falls* tunnel tour today.  

Camilla did some early morning drawing.

While waiting for the girls in the rest room, someone offerred to take my photo against a photo backdrop at the welcome center.

There were lines in the tunnels to see the two views from behind the waterfall.  

At the end of the tunnel, the view looked like this:

The falling water was a little loud for Camilla, so she held her ears.

We skipped the second tunnel view (which was identical) so we didn't have to wait in another tunnel line.
