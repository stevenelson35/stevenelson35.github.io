The first day on Sanibel was Saint Patrick's Day and we relaxed around the house.  

Camilla opened some early gifts for her upcoming birthday.

For lunch we drove to the Sunshine Cafe for a St. Patrick's day meal.  Linda and my parents had corned-beef and cabbage.  Camilla and I opted for standard menu items.  We all enjoyed ice cream dessert.   

This was the first time my parents saw Linda's new Volvo XC60 Plugin Hybrid.

One gift Camilla enjoyed was a *hula hoop*!
