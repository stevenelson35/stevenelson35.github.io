On our second full day in Montreal we walked to the underground city and a tourist section of town.  

We walked along the main road along the park with some sculptures and this stairway art.

We entered the undergound city through the metro depot.  Since there are entrances to the city tunnels all over the place, we had trouble finding a way to enter it. Not knowing French probably didn't help.

Much of the underground city is a shopping malls.  That's probably why the next day someone laughed when we mentioned we had gone to the undergound city and they said "oh, you mean the shopping mall".

On the way back from the mall, we stopped at a park with a tree sculpture.

Being worn out from a day of walking, we stopped at a familiar place -- McDonald's -- where we found a few different menu items than we were used to like the McWrap, Snack Wrap, vegitarian (meatless) Big Mac, and some baked goods.

Camilla had a drink and was already wearing her new high-tops from the mall.

At the touristy area of Montreal, Camilla tried on some hats.

I had bought a pair of Levi's at the mall. While shopping at the touristy shops, we found out that the security tag was not removed from my jeans, so we decided to split up.

I trekked back to the mall to get the security tag removed (and secretly returned to the touristy shops to get Linda's travel gift) and quickly stopped for a few photos along the way.

Meanwhile, Linda and Camilla returned to the condo and had ice cream.
