Sunday morning we toured the [Salisbury House](https://salisburyhouse.org/about_salisbury_house.php 'Salisbury House') of the Weeks family.  

Camilla put on some pink hair extensions before we drove to the Salisbury House.

We gave ourselves a self guided tour of the house built by cosmetics and pharmaceutical businessman Carl Weeks and his wife Edith. They had four boys.

The house was modeled after the King's House in Salisbury, England.

Edith was an Art History major and the house has many paintings on display. The painter with the most paintings in the house was Ghent, who seemed to paint in a *blurry* style, so I didn't take any pictures of hers work ;P.  

Photos of other paintings are below.  

*Head of a Girl* painting (below).

*Saint Catherine of Alexandria*' painting (below).  
Her miracle was that after sentenced to a slow death by spiked roller, the torture devices wheel broke and beheaded her so she received an instantaneous death.

Some brands of [Weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Weeks 'Carl Weeks') businesses included Armand and Weeks & Leo Co.

The house was built for $150,000, but cost about $3,000,000 to finish and decorate (which is equivalent to about $40,000,000 at the time the poster I read was created).  

Here are some pics of the bathrooms.

One of Weeks' businesses was one of the first companies to refuse to sell its products to shops that would offer discounts on their products.  The case went to the supreme court before it was lost.

> Carl revolutionized the face powder market by combining cold cream into face powder. The product was marketed as “ARMAND’S COMPLEXION POWDER IN THE LITTLE PINK & WHITE HAT BOX” and “ARMAND COLD CREAM POWDER In The LITTLE PINK & WHITE HAT BOXES”.
