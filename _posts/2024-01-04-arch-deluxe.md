We drove through St. Louis from Iowa to Mt. Vernon, IL.

Camilla didn't say this on the trip, but she said it:

We stayed at the Douboletree which we had stayed at in the past, but, this time we realize it is a dump.  

We remembered that last time it was cheap, had a nice pool, large rooms with balconies with couches overlooking the lobby, but was a bit dark.  

This time we noticed that the darkness was hiding the fact that it was very dirty. And this time, the hot tub was polluted by bodily fluids. It was very green in color and had brown floating suds.  

Better to forget that experience and remember the beautiful arch (which we have never stopped to see up close -- yet).
