On our first full day in San Francisco, Linda and Camilla drove to Berkeley to see Linda's brother's family.  

For lunch, we ate at the pub on the corner near our hotel.

Later in the day, I walked to the Powell Street Station and took the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to Berkeley, too.  I saw some trolleys along the half mile walk.

I found my way to the station pretty easily by simply following the signs.

Linda seemed surprised that I got on the correct train and got off at the correct stop.

But, she trusted me to help get them back to San Francisco on the BART later that evening.
