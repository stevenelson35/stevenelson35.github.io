We drove the rest of the way to San Francisco today and ate wood fired pizza around the block from our hotel.  

The drive today from Arcata to San Francisco was shorter than the day before.  Some of the roads were winding and we saw some big trees.

We drove quickly past many wineries and noticed some names that we recognized like [Kendall Jackson Winery](http://kj.com), [Francis Ford Coppola Winery](http://thefamilycoppola.com), and [Nelson Family Vineyards](http://nelsonfamilyvineyards.com) but didn't get any pictures.

We passed Vallejo.

Once we got near San Francisco we saw the black smoke in the sky for the first time on our trip. We're not sure if this smoke was from a fire or not. 
Previously we only saw gray hazy sky when we thought we were near fires.

We passed Alcatraz, saw the San Francisco skyline, and crossed over a famous bridge.

And walked to get pizza before picking up some groceries at the market.
