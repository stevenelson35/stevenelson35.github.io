We had a long drive from Oceanside, OR to Arcata, CA today. Arcata was a change of plans from our intended stop in Klamath Falls since there are fires in the area. Since the coastal road to Arcata had potential closures, we took the long way through a national forest.  

We left Oceanside.

And drove.

Saw some hazy smokey skies.

Eventually we got to California.

And drove some more.

And drove through the Six Rivers National Forest.

And had a private escort through construction.

And were tired when we got to Arcata.
