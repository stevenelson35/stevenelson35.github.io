A long day of driving meant rest stops and fast food.

Not long after getting on the road, our windshield found a pebble. And later, we noticed this crack which we got fixed a few days later in Stamford at Safelite.

After breakfast at McDonald's and lunch at Subway, Camilla did a little dance.

Later she drew a picture in the car while taking a break from hours of youtubing.

After a long day of driving, we had Papa John's for dinner at the `Holiday Inn Express` in `Edgewood, MD` which was near a vet clinic and a `Red Roof Inn`.

Sometimes Camilla likes to be carried. Fortunately, she can still fit in a bag.
