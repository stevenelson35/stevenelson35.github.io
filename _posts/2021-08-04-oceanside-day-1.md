title: Oceanside Day 1

On our first full day in Oceanside, we walked down to the village for breakfast, explored the beach, and drove to Rockaway Trail Head to see the oldest Cedar in Oregon.  

In the morning, Linda spotted a deer outside our bedroom window that had spent the night in the tall grass beside the beachhouse.
