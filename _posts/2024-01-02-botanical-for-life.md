Our first day in Iowa consisted of going to Brueggar's Bagels, a shopping mall, the Volvo store, the Botanical Garden, and dinner at Cool Basil.  

First we went to the Jordan Creek shopping mall, which is a large, successful mall that has apparently contributed to the closing of other malls in the area. 

Camilla danced a bit in *The Gap*.

After meeting Lori for lunch at *Brueggar's Bagels*, we took a detour to the *Volvo* store because a `Check Engine Emission` light lit up on the dash on our way to the *Des Moines Botanical Garden*.

At the garden, we were on the hunt for 50 gnomes and other items on the scavenger hunt list.

At the entrance of the garden was a *Living Wall* with about two-thousand plants.
