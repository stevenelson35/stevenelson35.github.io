There was a light rain most of the day before we left for a night in Portland where the whether cleared up.  

Linda and Camilla got in some good screen time during the rain (and Linda worked to prepare the beach house for our departure in a few days).  

I made it down to the village morning restaurant for coffee and saw these flowers on the way back up the hillside.

In the afternoon Linda drove us to Portland where we ate at the hotel and attempted to swim in the pool (but were too tired).
