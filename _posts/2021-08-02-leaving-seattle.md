We picked up a rental car, saw Linda's Aunt and Uncle for lunch, and drove to Oceanside Oregon today.

This was the first day we had to get things done in the morning since we needed to checkout of the hotel. Camilla wore her ***flamingo*** dress :).

As we left the hotel, we met a robot cleaning the hallway carpet.  ***Beep, Boop***.

We walked to a bus stop to get a ride to the rental car.  I carried the car seat, so we glad I had found a slight short cut up the King Street Station stairs to the bus stop about two blocks away.  Linda had paid for the bus tickets online by phone, but, it didn't seem like the bus driver cared to confirm payment, since we just walked on.

We drove north to a restaurant near Washington State University to go to lunch.  We drove around near the campus for an hour siteseeing and failing to find a parking spot to get out and explore the area on foot.  Getting stuck waiting for the bridge made us decide to cut the driving tour short so we could get gas and make it to the restuarant on time.

After lunch, we headed south towards Portland.

And then west to Oceanside.  Which sent us through a tunnel under some homes.

Down some hills (and apparently up some, too).

We arrived before a late sunset.  Here's the view on the last mile to hour destination.

And here's the view from our home-for-a-week in Oceanside.
