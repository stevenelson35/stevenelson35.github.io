We had a full Monday taking a walk, going to Captiva for lunch, and seeing wildlife.  

Linda and I took Frankie for a walk to the Marina and Grandma Dots restaurant.

Where we saw some small fish under the docks and a dark bird.

Camilla and Grandma took Mia for a walk while Camilla was still in her PJs.

For lunch we went to a traditional favorite restaurant - The Mucky Duck.  Although parking was difficult, we got in quickly even though it was a busy spring break weekend on the islands.

We went to J.N. Ding Darling Wildlife Sanctuary after lunch.  

While there, Linda volunteered to takea picture of a family on vacation.  Later, Camilla realized that the family happened to be that of her good friend from school -- they hadn't recognized each other :).  

Outside the education center the walls and ceiling were decorated with a 3-D mural.

Camilla read some wildlife information at the education center.

We wore hats to protect ourselves from the sun.

The man at the guard house mentioned that a gator had been reported at the end of the boardwalk down the first trail, so that's where we headed.

Dad didn't come on the long trail, but did get out to see some birds in the estuary off the road.
