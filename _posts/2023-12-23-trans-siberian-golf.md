We kicked off our winter break with the gift of Trans-Siberian Ochestra tickets from Linda's work.  

(Thanks Dr. Williams!).  

Camilla had a blast dancing (even though it was a bit loud).

Saturday we went bowling and mini golfing with Patrick while he was in town from Iowa.  

Linda was the bowling champion with her best score of 151; including 2 strikes and a number of spares. Patrick was runner up.

We left golfing half-way through because it was getting late and it was very busy and slow playing.
