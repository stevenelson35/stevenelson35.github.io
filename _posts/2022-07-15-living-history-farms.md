We spent the midday at Living History Farms.

The [Living History Farms](http://lhf.org 'Living History Farms') was near the home we rented in Urbandale, IA.

One home had some Norwegian decorative tools hanging on the wall.

At one time, the tools may have been used for flattening clothes (ironing), but here they were a carved gift to a fiance called a *mangle board* --since the home depicted a period after the iron had been invented.

The main street in the town had buildings for drugs, a law office, and a millinery (pictured below).  There were also a bank, newspaper, general store, and a blacksmith.

A the end of the main street was a church.  Linda remembered being a bridesmaid for a friends wedding in this church a long long time ago ;).

Camilla liked talking to the dress maker in the building containing two women-owned businesses (a milliner in the front and a dress maker in the back).

> The real things haven't changed. It is still best to be honest and truthful; to make the most of what we have; to be happy with simple pleasures; and have courage when things go wrong.

- Laura Ingalls Wilder

Further from the main street was a Veterinary Infirmary.

We took a long tractor ride to a trail where we walked to see three farms from different ages.  We were most interested in finding some animals, which were in the last (1900) farm.  Along the way we saw some bores.

We crossed a bridge.

And found a piglet named *Peanut* at the last farm.
