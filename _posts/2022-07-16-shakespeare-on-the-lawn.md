Saturday night we went to see King Lear on the lawn at the Salisbury house.  

We sat on a blanket just off stage left with a charcuterie snack box.

Fortunately, Camilla is very thankful --that is, unless you try to keep her up past 9pm.  

We left at the intermission, but that was really too late for Camilla.
