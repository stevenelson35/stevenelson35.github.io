Camilla was tired of swimming so the morning of our checkout from Great Wolf Lodge we played in the arcade before going to a hotel by Niagara Falls.

Camilla's favorite games were a virtual car ride, a motorbike game, and air hockey.

Linda's favorite game was a stacking game. It was a bit too addictive, so in the future we'll have to watch her around arcades with that game.

At the arcade, you earn virtual tickets for each game played that you can exchange for a prize.  Camilla's goal was to get a blow pop sucker.  She got one and the blue teeth in this picture is proof.

In this next picture, Camilla is giving me the 'no more pictures' finger, but smiling. Sometimes she isn't smiling when she does that.

We considered eating at the rotating tower restaurant to see the falls from above.  We even had reservations twice.  But, with the Canadian fires we didn't think the view would be as good as from the ground due to the smokey haze in the air.

There was a sign describing Louis Hennepin, who may be the person after which the county in Minnesota I grew up in was named.

I was most impressed by the powerful water as it went over the edge of Horse Shoe Falls.
