Today we said goodbye to Russ and Lori and had dinner with Patrick. 

Camilla took a picture with Linda's sister and brother-in-law before they started driving east.

Later in the day we had Charlotte's Kitchen takeout chicken for dinner and then walked to a park.

We saw a white-tailed bunny.

We learned that Camilla likes to plug her ears and close her eyes when she hums.

In the evening we started to pack up for an early departure the next morning for our drive south toward home.  

Camilla said goodbye to Romeo.
