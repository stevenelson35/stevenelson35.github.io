Today we said goodbye to Russ and Lori and had dinner with Patrick. 

Camilla took a picture with Linda's sister and brother-in-law before they started driving east. 


Later in the day we had Charlotte's Kitchen takeout chicken for dinner and then walked to a park.


In the evening we started to pack up for an early departure the next morning for our drive south towards home.
