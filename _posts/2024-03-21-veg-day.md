On our first day back we focused on preparing our yard for the future late birthday party.  

I got up early to get more supplies from Lowes and saw this sunrise on Chapman.

Part of the yardwork included cleaning up the paths from the gates to the back yard with mulch and stepping stones.  Here is Frankie inspecting my work and confirming it is up to his standards as a new place to pee ;).
