There was a light rain most of the day before we left for a night in Portland where we saw blue skies and sunshine for the first time in a while.  

Linda and Camilla got in some good screen time during the rain (and Linda worked to prepare the beach house for our departure in a few days).  

I made it down to one of the two village restaurants that are open in the morning for coffee.  I saw these flowers on the way back up the hillside.  And that was the only picture for the day.

In the afternoon Linda drove us to Portland where we ate at the hotel and attempted to swim in the pool (but were too tired).
