Nav computer issues meant our shorter driving day wasn't that short after all.

The *Holiday Inn Express* in *Edgewood, MD*, had a pancake robot.

We stopped at a rest stop.

In *Maryland* we drove throw the *Baltimore Harbor Tunnel* and saw this chimney.

Google Maps had many issues with an instability in switching routes around New York City possibly due to changing traffic around the George Washington Bridge and the Maryland/Delaware route.

One example was that Google Maps suggested a route to exit a highway and then immediately re-enter the highway to avoid a 23min delay on a small bridge. However, the road for the detour no longer allows you to re-enter the highway without driving around the block and contending with additional traffic. This is the Maw of blackholes that sucked up a half hour to lead us back to the highway behind the same truck we were behind when we left it. The one benefit was we did get to see *Minnesota Ave.* ;)

Camilla thought these powerlines looked like cats. :)

Grabbed lunch at the *Joe Biden* rest stop in *Delaware*.  

Linda was happy to see a *Weeping Willow* tree, which we don't see often in Florida.

We saw the *New York City* skyline as we drove through *New Jersey* and then continued past some beautiful homes in *Englewood, NJ* before finally navigating or way to the *Cuomo* bridge to cross towards *White Plains* and on to *Stamford*.

After a settling in, we went to dinner in Stamford and walked near a harbor with swings and a sandbox.
