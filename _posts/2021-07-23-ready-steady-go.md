Tomorrow we set sail for unknown shores as the first day of our month long trip across the country begins.  

We'll be leaving Florida the day after Camilla celebrated Christmas in July on her last day of school with her class.  When we return from vacation, she will begin VPK in a new class at the same school.

The first leg of our travels has us driving north for three days with hotel stops in Ooltewah, TN and Keokuk, IA on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.  

Over the next four weeks, highlights will include seeing family in Des Moines, the Twin Cities, Seattle, and Berkley while we explore the western half of the United States by train.  If we find time, we'll post updates to this blog.

Let the adventure begin!
