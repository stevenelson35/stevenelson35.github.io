On our last day in the Bay Area we went to Berkeley for pizza at Linda's brother's.  

First I had to get some caffeine before work and saw a familiar name on a hotel roof sign during my walk around the block.

I found my way back to our hotel.

After work we walked to the Powell Street Station and saw the California state flag on the way. I think it is Linda's favorite flag. It has a bear on it.

We also saw some trolley cars.

In Berkeley Camilla requested to have her picture taken in this alcove.

On the way home, Linda and Camilla watched the lights of the city from the bay bridge.
