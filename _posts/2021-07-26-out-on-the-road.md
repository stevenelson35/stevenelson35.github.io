A full day of driving brings us to Keokuk, IA.

Lot's of screen time for Camilla today again as we travelled in six states in one day (and Tennessee twice)! [TN, GA, TN, KY, IL, MO, IA].

In Peducah, we ate lunch in quiet cemetary next to a subway (again with the lobby closed due to staff shortages).  Suprised how short some of the lives seemed as listed on the headstones.

Driving through the country we see lots of beautiful scenic areas, but, it's hard to take picture from a car.  Here's one from our stop in Peducah.

We have a non-binding agreement that we will stop at the St. Louis arch or somewhere with a better view of it on our way back south.  Camilla **may** have seen it as we drove by quickly. And maybe a stop in Hannibal to see Mark Twain, too.

And we arrived in Keokuk (again, too late to swim).  Maybe someday.
