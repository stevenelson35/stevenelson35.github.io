We began our summer road trip after a Ballet Camp Recital of Nemo's Adventure.

Here's a short video of the last 30 seconds of the ballet recital where Camilla and friends are doing a final dance and leaving the stage.

(30 seconds)

Our trip includes stops in:
- Stamford, Connecticut, USA.
- Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
- Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.

We said goodbye to the cats, Teddy and Ivory, who will stay home alone for two weeks (with a robot litter box, a robot feeder, and care from a daily human health inspector and photographer).

The trip will include a lot of driving and may require learning some French.  

At this point, my French consists of what I've learned from Peppa Pig years ago:

> `le petite jete` and `pas de doux`.

After dinner at Salsa's on I-95, we stayed at a very clean *Red Roof Inn* in Darien, GA. Camilla's friend Isla shared her roses after the recital.

And the driving begins!
