Saturday we said goodbye to Dentel's and left *Stamford* to begin our drive to *Des Moines*.  

Camilla took advantage of the fact that it had finally stopped raining long enough that the trampoline was dry.

Camilla said goodbye to Sarah and Brian.

> So goodbye yellow brick road

> Where the dogs of society howl

> You can't plant me in your penthouse

> I'm going back to my plough

> Back to the howling old owl in the woods

> Hunting the horny-back toad

> Oh, I've finally decided my future lies

> Beyond the yellow brick road


- Elton John & Bernie Taupin
