On the second day of a three day drive we made it from *DuBois* to *Chesterton*.  

Along the way, we saw signs for *Sharon* and *West*.

And eventually, we were excited to see that it had begun to snow.

We had thought that it might be too warm this trip to have a chance to see snow. But we did.

We checked into our hotel in *Chesterton*.

And then played in the snow a bit on our walk to the pizza restaurant across the street for our New Year's Eve dinner.

Camilla got to through a snowball for the first time.
