We took a weekend trip to Sanibel for Fathers Day 2022 to see my parents.  

We got an early start driving on Friday morning, Camilla dressed comfortably for the ride.

Since flamingo's are still Camilla's favorite bird, we went to the Lazy Flamingo for lunch and I wore a flamingo shirt.

We need to get Camilla back in swim lessons again.

To avoid the heat, we made sure to get out to the beach Saturday morning before it got too hot.

A quick stop at Manatee park revealed -- no manatees.  But, this red bug was pretty neat!
