The last stretch of our trek home started north of Atlanta.  

Camilla did some breakfast stretches.

And then tried to burn some energy twirling before starting our last long car ride.

We stopped at the Florida Welcome Center to use the restroom and inquire about the advertised cheap amusement park tickets, but, passed since it required a time share presentation. However, we did see this humungous banana spider outside the building.

Later we stopped at Panera for our last lunch on the road fifty miles from Camilla City.

Finally we arrived home, unpacked, retrieved all the pets, and a week later were able to take this family photo for Camilla to bring to school for her new VPK class.
