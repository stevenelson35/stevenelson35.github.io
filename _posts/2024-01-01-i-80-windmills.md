On New Year's Day we drove I-80 the rest of the way to *Johnston, IA*.  

Perhaps stopping at a gas station McDonald's for lunch isn't the best way to start my New Year's resolutions on diet and exercise, but it was convenient. And we still had another day of driving to get through.  

The most exciting thing we saw along the drive was a bald eagle flying along I-80. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of that.  

Actually, I wasn't able to get any interesting pictures on this day as we were getting restless from so much driving and my travel companions are rarely in the mood to have their picture taken even when they are not going stir crazy.  

The second most exciting thing we saw along the way were windmills.  

And the third was apparently Linda's ear.
