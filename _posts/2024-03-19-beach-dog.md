On our last day we took Frankie with us to the beach.  

Cammilla lead the way to the beach.  We noticed that the boardwalk that used to connect the parking lot to the beach was no longer there.

The beach had been restored with many, many truck loads of sand since rebuilding started after the hurricane over a year ago.

Camilla was first to wade into the gulf.

Linda focused on shelling while Camilla played in the surf.

Eventually we all looked for shells.

Even Frankie.

I took Frankie for a walk.  We went further inland whenever someone walking a dog would approach so that Frankie wouldn't see them and bark.  He barks loudly.  He is a friendly dog.  But, also a loud one ;).

Camilla played in the water.

She also made a sand castle.

And walked with her mom.

Once we got home, we went right to work on getting supplies for fixing up our yard.  We had a lot to do to get ready for Camilla's birthday party we were having in our backyard (two weeks after her birthday).
