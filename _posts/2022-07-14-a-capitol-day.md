Des Moines food, Science Center of Iowa, and a quick tour of the State Capitol.  

We knocked off the two *must eats* in Des Moines for breakfast and lunch on our first day: *Bruegger's Bagels* and *Spaghetti Works*.

At the Science Center, in the Star Theater planetarium, when the speaker asked what a specific asterism looked like, Camilla said *a giraffe?* -- and she had the correct answer. It was the asterism *Cameloparalis*.

Linda touched a Gopher Snake (aka bullsnake) named *Kisses*. That is the largest type of snake found in Iowa.

Camilla also touched the snake. She told the care taker that she had touched a python when the zoo came to her school this spring.  I did not touch the snake ;).

We saw a snapping turtle eat lunch.

And Linda and Camilla built satellites.

There was a model of Perseverance, one of the Mars rovers, which seemed larger than I had imagined.

Camilla was excited being at the center; running around doing all the activities.  However, the place seemed in need of attention / donations.  Many of the displays were broken. Even this simple one.

Other than learning about the stars of the night sky (which I will forget in a day), learning one advanced Lego technique was the highlight for me.  That, I will remember forever :).

After leaving the Science Museum, Camilla asked *"may I watch your phone for a little bit"* (which is common when getting into the car), but this time she claimed:

Next we went to the State Capitol.

At the State Capitol, we saw the dolls of all the First Ladies and the First First Man.

Outside we walked to a statue and tried to stay cool resting in its shade.
