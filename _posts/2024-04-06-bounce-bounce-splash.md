Camilla had friends over for a pool party to celebrate her seventh birthday.  

There was a bounce house with slide - which eventually became a water slide :).

Camilla was so excited at her party that she entered the pool with a big running leap.

After the party Camilla had some time to play in the bounce house before they came to pack it up.

Frankie was happy to get back outside after the party.
