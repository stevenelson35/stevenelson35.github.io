We went for a morning swim in Danbury.

It was a rare opportunity to see Camilla without glasses.

Our first task in Danbury was to stop by L.L.Bean.  

We exchanged Linda's Christmas boots and bought Camilla a jacket (since we forgot her new winter jacket at home in Florida).

While looking at homes and schools in Danbury and the surrounding area, we stopped at a park.

And Camilla met a friend.

The schools looked nice.

Of the small towns around Danbury, Ridgefield had the most inviting main street.

Which inluded a busy public library.

Once it got dark, it was too difficult to continue exploring on the winding, hilly roads, so we made our way to Dentel's for the rest of the week.  

Sarah joined Camilla for some coloring before bedtime.
