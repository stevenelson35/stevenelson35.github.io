We drove from Mt. Vernon, IL to McDonough, GA.  

The parking lot of the DoubleTree was stacked with truck cabs.

On the route we passed a sign that looked like it was for the Beatles.

Apparently in 1963, before the Beattles were big, George Harrison would visit his sister in [Benton, IL](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/george-harrison-commemorative-mural) and they have a commemorative mural near the highway as shown in the picture above.  

Later on the drive Linda saw a large black dog with a collar north of Eddyville, so we called the non-emergency police to report the loose dog near the busy highway. There were a lot of speed traps in the area, so there's a chance one of the police cars we saw along the road might have taken the dog to safety.  

We had hoped to drive far enough that the remainder of the trip would be an easy Saturday morning drive (of 3-4 hours) to arrive in Oviedo in time for Camilla's friend's birthday party.  

However, we ended up stopping at a hotel in McDonough, just south of Atlanta, which left six hours driving for Saturday.  

This Courtyard Inn was a much cleaner hotel than we encountered in Mt. Vernon, but...  

The pool was closed.  

So, we spent a few minutes in the fitness center before turning in for an early night.

Another song George Harrison wrote was "While my guitar gently weeps" which featured Eric Clapton on guitar.  

However, there is a very good live cover which features *Prince* on guitar at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
