We spent one full day at Great Wolf Lodge swimming, sliding, and playing MagicQuest in the hotel.

Camilla's was surprised how big the water park was.

Camilla was tall enough to go on all the water slides. She was brave enough to try the small ones and a medium one.  The larger slides will have to wait for another day.

MagicQuest is a game you can play in the hotel which involves completing a scavenger hunt where you look for magic pictures, chests, books, and kiosks that react when you point a wand at them.  It keeps kids busy walking back and forth and going up and down stairs in the hotel.
