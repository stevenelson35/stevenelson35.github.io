We started our three day journey back to Oviedo today. 

While packing up the car, we lost sight of Romeo and fears he had snuck outside.  After searching the house, down the street, and asking the neighbor if they'd seen a cat, Linda realized that Romeo had been hiding under a bed.  


Our non-binding agreement to stop at the American Gothic House, Hannibal, and the St. Loius Arch over ruled by the driver. I did capture a slightly better drive-by picture of the Arch.  

We arrived at the hotel in enough time to enjoy the swimming pool and hot tub before bed.
