Our final day of driving before returning home.  

After getting on the road, we stopped at a gas station for breakfast.  Camilla had Cinnabon.

After arriving in Orlando, we took Suellen out for dinner at Agave Azul on Semoran and picked up Frankie.  Camilla wore flowers from the drinks in her hair.

Camilla was excited to return to school and see her friends.

Being home, we could return to our routine and also try out some Christmas gifts, like piggy paint for Camilla's nails.

Camilla missed her cats.

We all had missed the furry members of the family.
