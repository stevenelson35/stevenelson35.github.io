On Mother's Day we went to Leu Gardens after Camilla's swim lesson.   

We forgot to bring a brush, so Camilla wasn't able to comb her hair after swimming, but we did remember to bring sun hats.  

First we stopped at Panera for lunch and to pose by a tree.

At the end of the trip to Leu Gardens we took a family photo (foreshadowing).

This was the last day of the **Glass In Flight** sculpture exhibit at Leu Gardens. Here's an example of the type of sculptures that were scattered throughout the gardens.

We didn't put much effort into finding all the sculptures even though there was a map. We just wandered around and saw what we saw.  

We saw one bird. Here it is.

Here's another sculture with glass wings.

In a shady gazebo we took a *mother daughter* photo in honor of Mother's Day.  At least that was an acceptable reason for me to convince Linda and Camilla to look at the camera without being too annoyed.

We even took one rare photo without Camilla's glasses.

We saw one tree with peeling green bark.

A butterly was stealing some flower stuff from a flower in the vegetable garden.

On the fence of the vegetable garden Linda identified some blackberries that were just starting to ripen.

Fortunately there are a lot of trees at Leu Garden. One time when we were out of tree cover, Camilla ran to the next shady spot to stay out of the sun. In reality, she probably was just looking for an opportunity to run. She likes to run and doesn't like to stand still very often.  

During our walk arou d the gardens, I took some pics of flowers, trees, and ocassionally Camilla and Linda.  

Here's a Magnolia Flower.

Here's a tree.

Most pictures I have of Linda and Camilla are of them walking away from me, like this:

This flower had a red bug on it; just like the red bug we saw in Fort Myers which appears in another blog post.

We found a shady spot with a bench so we sat down to rest.  

Camilla had too much energy so she played charades instead of resting.

While Linda sat in the shade where we had played charades, Camilla posed by some metal sculptures.  

Here's the *kid on a scooter* sculpture. Camilla is holding a rose horizontally to match the pose in the sculpture of the kid on a scooter.  The rose was given to Linda at the entrance of the park for Mother's Day.

Sometimes Camilla posed with me.  

Here's the *kid on shoulders* sculpture with me posing with a kid on my shoulders.

And here's the *grandpa and kid fishing* sculpture and Camilla holding her rose fishing rod.

We saw a red pineapple in two locations in the gardens.  Here's one.

It slowly became warmer throughout the day, but overall the weather was surprising pleasant considering the recent days of high ninety degree weather in Orlando.  After a few hours we left the trees, flowers, and glass sculptures behind.
