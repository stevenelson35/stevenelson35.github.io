On Mother's Day we went to Leu Gardens after Camilla's swim lesson.   

we forgot to bring a brush, so Camilla wasn't able to come her hair, but we did remember to bring sun hats.  

But first we stopped at Panera for lunch and to pose by a tree.

At the end of the trip to Leu Gardens we took a family photo. Here's some foreshadowing. ;)

We saw one bird. Here it is.

One flower in the vegetable garden was stealing some flower stuff.

On the fence of the vegetable garden Linda identified some blackberries -- that were just starting to ripen.

Fortunately there are a lot of trees at Leu Garden. One time we were out of tree cover Camilla ran to the next shady spot. Probably not so much as to protect herself from the sun or heat, but, just because she likes to run.

This was the last day of the **Glass** sculpture exhibit at Leu Gardens. Here's an example of the type of sculptures that were scattered throughout the gardens.

We didn't put much effort into finding all the sculptures even though there was a map. We just wondered around and saw what we saw.  

And I took some pics of flowers, trees, and ocassionally Camilla and Linda when they would allow it.

We found a shady spot with a bench so we sat down to rest.  

But Camilla had too much energy and played charades.

While Linda say in the shade where we had played charades, Camilla posed by some metal sculptures.  

Here's the kid on a scooter sculpture. Camilla is holding the flower to look like the handle of the scooter.

And sometimes she posed with me.  

Here's the kid on shoulders sculpture.
