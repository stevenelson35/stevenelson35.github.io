It took most of a day to drive from Montreal to Niagara Falls.  

Camilla got in some early Netflix viewing before we set out for a day in the car.

We made one stop for lunch at a Canadian rest stop.

Camilla was excited to arrive at the Great Wolf Lodge and join the dance party.

Our accomodations at [Great Wolf Lodge](https://www.greatwolf.com/) included a *Wolf Den* with bunk beds.
