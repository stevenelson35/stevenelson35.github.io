We took a day to return to Ridgefield to gather more info about the homes and schools.  

Camilla started the day with a little tablet time while waiting for us to leave.

In Ridgefield we had breakfast at [Dimitri's Diner](https://www.dimitrisdiner.com/) before driving around the area and checking out the homes, schools, and grocery store.  

Eventually we made our way to Norwalk and stopped at the [Maritime Aquarium](https://www.maritimeaquarium.org/).
